        "Starting in the last week March/ first week April, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus has posted the recommendations which include:  - Do not go out of the house unless it is particularly necessary (going to work, buying food and medicines, receiving medical and other vital services).  - Do not leave home to visit places that are not vital (libraries, museums, cinemas, theaters, and other public places). Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

        "Starting in the last week March/ first week April, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus has posted the recommendations which include:  - Do not go out of the house unless it is particularly necessary (going to work, buying food and medicines, receiving medical and other vital services).  - Do not leave home to visit places that are not vital (libraries, museums, cinemas, theaters, and other public places). Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

        "No new policies.  Continuing from April 8, 2020, the Ministry of Health and the Minsk City Executive Committee posted social distancing policies, including:  - to walk your pets alone   - elevators should be used alone  - in a private car, there must be only family members living in the same house in the cabin. (An exception is the need to accompany a person in an emergency situation)  - face masks were made mandatory in all enclosed public spaces.   - the legal requirements for business owners to maintain physical distance for customers (of at least 1.5m and post information about the need to maintain a safe distance)  - refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people.

        "Starting in the last week March/ first week April, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus has posted the recommendations which include:  - Do not go out of the house unless it is particularly necessary (going to work, buying food and medicines, receiving medical and other vital services).  - Do not leave home to visit places that are not vital (libraries, museums, cinemas, theaters, and other public places). Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

        "Starting in the last week March/ first week April, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus has posted the recommendations which include:  - Do not go out of the house unless it is particularly necessary (going to work, buying food and medicines, receiving medical and other vital services).  - Do not leave home to visit places that are not vital (libraries, museums, cinemas, theaters, and other public places). Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants.

        "Starting in the last week March/ first week April, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus has posted the recommendations which include:  - Do not go out of the house unless it is particularly necessary (going to work, buying food and medicines, receiving medical and other vital services).  - Do not leave home to visit places that are not vital (libraries, museums, cinemas, theaters, and other public places). Children may only go out with the family. Arrange to walk pets alone.  - Refrain from attending classes in clubs, sports clubs, gyms, even with a minimum number of participants. In case you continue sports activities, make sure that the group size does not exceed 5 people and that a distance of 1.5-2 m between people is maintained during the activities.  - Communicate with others remotely by means of communication. Do not visit or host friends and family members who do not live with you.  - The following measures can be used to reduce the need to leave the house: remote work, video calls and conference calls; Each employer must ensure that a distance of 1-1.5 meters between employees' workplaces, personal hygiene and environmental (room) hygiene is maintained;  - Choose delivery services - only to the doorstep of the apartment (house, office);  - If you go out of the house in situations where it is necessary (see point 1), it is necessary to reduce contact with other people and keep a 1.5 - 2 meter distance from each other.

        "This may be one reason Belarus also outperformed most of Europe in terms of mass testing during the first four months of the pandemic. While many countries were reluctant to carry out extensive testing, according to the state owned news agency BelTA, testing in Belarus started as early as 23 January. Most kits were donated or purchased from China and Russia2 using government funds and donations from companies3 and ordinary citizens.4 The country stepped up testing in early April,5 developing its own rapid testing kits6 and switching to the use of domestically produced reagents for polymerase chain reaction testing in May.7 According to government information, there are now 32 laboratories processing samples across the country and testing is widespread in hospitals as well as from GPs.  http://web.archive.org/web/20210413102919/https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3543",
