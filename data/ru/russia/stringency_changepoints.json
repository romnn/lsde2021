Small companies and organizations in the regions are particularly affected. Most of them relate to small and medium-sized businesses.

Among the support measures that Russian media will be able to use include a six-month deferral of all taxes (except VAT), as well as rental payments when using real estate owned by state, municipal or private property, interest-free loans for urgent needs and salaries, soft loans at a rate of 2% for any purpose, a moratorium on bankruptcy, conducting scheduled and unscheduled inspections.    In addition, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses from the affected sectors are provided with a deferral of payment of insurance premiums (and halving their size if the wages of workers are higher than 1 minimum wage), restructuring of payments formed during the period of granting a deferral of tax and insurance contributions for a period for one year monthly in equal installments.    They also have direct financial support in the form of subsidies (grants), which can be spent on salaries, payment of debts for utilities. Funds are provided at the rate of 1 minimum wage for each employee.

Such an order was signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.    Russian citizens will be able to leave the country to visit close relatives living abroad and those who are in need of care.

Rather, as they inform \"A citizen who has difficulties with payments on loans or borrowings due to a decrease in income, first of all, should inform his creditors about this and request an option for debt restructuring\".   In accordance with the law, citizens can apply for a grace period for payments (credit holidays) if their income in the month preceding the date of application has decreased by at least 30% compared to the average monthly income in 2019. You can also apply for a credit vacation if the size of the loan (loan) taken does not exceed the maximum amount established by the Government of the Russian Federation.  -> this measure is only for \"the most needy segments of the population\". Moreover, Russian citizens often complain that the procedure is complex, and it is often impossible for them to provide officials with supporting document.
