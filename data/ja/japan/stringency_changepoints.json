In addition, for the time being, we have started implementing extraordinary measures to deny entry of foreign nationals who have any history of staying in Hubei Province within 14 days and those who possess a Chinese passport issued by Hubei Province, unless there is any specific need. I ask all of you to exert efforts to avoid trouble on the ground, by preventing those to whom those measures apply from boarding aircraft, through collaboration among relevant parties, including airlines.

While mask-wearing has become a controversial and almost political issue in some parts of the world, it is already culturally-engrained in Japan. During flu-season, but also year-round, people often wear masks to try to prevent one's own germs or sickness from spreading in public places. This is seen as particularly important in Japan's densely-populated cities. Aside from health reasons, people also regularly wear masks as a defence against dust and pollen, to cover up blemishes or the fact they are not wearing make-up, and even to make the wearer's face appear smaller! Therefore, while mask-wearing has become a hot topic in other parts of the world, they have undoubtedly become the societal norm since the spread of coronavirus, and many commentators have argued this has helped keep Japan's infection rate low.
