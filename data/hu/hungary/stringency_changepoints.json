        "The Hungarian government has in place an existing job seeker allowance. A benefit that replaces 60% of gross wages with the current minimum wage ceiling (minimum wage was EUR 487/month in January 2020), which is paid to the unemployed for three months instead of the previous nine months. Anyone who is still unemployed after three months must register for public work. If not, then they will be without any allowances. If they are still unemployed, then they must accept the work the state offers them. In recent weeks, the gov has loosened restrictions on this program to remove some of the paperwork, but net new income support policies have not been put in place. https://web.archive.org/web/20200507040409/https://hungarytoday.hu/number-of-unemployed-rising-govt-promises-jobs-in-3-months/ In fact, Prime Minister Orban seems opposed to such policies: https://web.archive.org/web/20200507040656/https://euobserver.com/opinion/148201      ",

The employer should:  - have been operating for at least 6 months,  - demonstrate that the reason behind the employment in reduced working time is directly and closely linked to the emergency situation, and provide credible evidence that the maintenance of headcount is essential to its continuous economic activity and thus of national economic interest,  - present the measures taken and expected so far to overcome the economic difficulties,  - demonstrate that, in respect of the above point, the employer has exhausted all the available opportunities to reschedule the working time, - fulfill the criteria of sound labor relations, no ongoing liquidation proceedings against the employer (e.g. voluntary liquidation, liquidation, bankruptcy proceedings),  - as of 31 December 2019, the employer was not classified as a company in difficulty.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200720075353/https://www2.deloitte.com/hu/en/pages/tax/articles/new-wage-subsidy-scheme-to-maintain-jobs.html    These rules suggest that these measures are not designed to cover all workers, especially those in the informal sector who are quite likely to find it difficult to adequately prove their eligibility.

In an interview given to public radio MR1, Hungarian State Secretary for Public Education Zoltan Maruzsa said that the digital education introduced in mid-March due to the novel coronavirus epidemic would continue until the summer break. \"However, the rigid ban which was introduced on March 14 will lift on June 2 so that where needed, small group or even individual consultations, or sessions for catching up will be permitted,\" the State Secretary said. \"Teachers and heads of institutions should consult with parents,\" Maruzsa added. He underlined that children will not be required to attend school, but cautioned that the opening could help a lot for those who for some reasons could not get into digital education.    https://web.archive.org/save/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/22/c_139076476.htm"
