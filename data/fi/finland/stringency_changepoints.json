        "16th March announcement that public gatherings are limited to no more than ten persons, and it is recommend to avoid spending unnecessary time in public places. You can go out but avoid close contact with other people. Going out is allowed as long as the person keeps a distance of at least 1-2 metres from other people. Stay home if symptomatic and you should stay home as much as possible. Healthy children can go play in playgrounds. To reduce the risk of infection, children should wear outdoor gloves and wash their hands immediately after playing. Public-sector employers will instruct public-sector employees to work from home if their duties make it possible to do so. We can and must still go to forest and enjoy the coming spring in our natural environment. However, we may wish to avoid the most popular hiking destinations and give preference for a day trip e.g. to a forest close to our home. Movie theatres are allowed to remain open, but it is recommended that they be closed. They may also show films, but they must not allow more than ten persons to be present at a screening at the same time.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113518/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus/current-restrictions  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425121730/https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/frequently-asked-questions-about-coronavirus-covid-19-  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425122428/https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/instructions-for-citizens-on-coronavirus  https://web.archive.org/web/20200503123029/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/10616/hallitus-totesi-suomen-olevan-poikkeusoloissa-koronavirustilanteen-vuoksi  https://web.archive.org/web/20200503123330/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus/questions-and-answers  https://web.archive.org/web/20200502101629/https://vnk.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitus-totesi-suomen-olevan-poikkeusoloissa-koronavirustilanteen-vuoksi  ",

'The five-day waiting period has been abolished starting 16 March. Unemployment benefits will be available from the first day of unemployment. The normal five-day waiting period will be applied again as of 7 July 2020.' 'The work requirement for qualifying for unemployment allowance has been reduced temporarily (.. ) The change will be effective until 6 July 2020.'     The Finnish benefits system is complicated, so it's not possible to clearly define whether income support is set at above or below 50% of normal earnings. There are multiple different types of benefits a person can receive depending on factors such as employment history and union membership. The amount of the base unemployment benefit provided by KELA is means-tested; increases to the base amount will be granted depending on conditions such as the number of children and the availability of other sources of income. Many people who lost their jobs will also be union members who receive earnings-related benefit that are calculated on the basis of duration of employment; in many cases this will be larger than the base amount.     https://web.archive.org/web/20200523110355/https://www.kela.fi/web/en/unemployment-benefit-corona",

Restrictions will also be lifted for residents of China and of the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions who are travelling from these regions to Finland, provided that reciprocity is confirmed by the Council of the European Union.

For example, contact teaching will be offered to students with disabilities that are receiving special needs education and to students who need individual support for various reasons. Distance learning will continue at these schools until 31 January 2021.    A mask recommendation has been issued for the area\u2019s lower secondary schools (grades 6-9). The cities will provide masks for this purpose, but students are also free to use their own.    Daycare centres and pre-primary education are still open, with due regard for the necessary safety measures. Daycare centre staff are encouraged to wear masks indoors whenever possible. Early childhood education employees who travel to several locations in their work, for example, daycare assistants, replacements, directors, trainees and interns are in particular asked to observe this mask recommendation. Parents and guardians of children in daycare and pre-primary education are asked to wear masks when they pick up and drop off their children and limit the time they spend indoors.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115123931/https://www.hel.fi/helsinki/coronavirus-en/childhood-and",

As of May 24 authorities are also lifting the traffic restrictions for residents of border communities at the nation's border with Norway.    All individuals arriving from countries with which travel is restricted are required to take a COVID-19 test upon entry unless they produce a negative result from a test taken within the previous 72 hours or evidence that they have been infected with COVID-19 in the previous six months. Arrivals are then asked to self-isolate for 14 days or until a negative result is confirmed from a second test taken no less than 72 hours after their arrival.
