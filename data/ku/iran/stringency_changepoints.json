        "Background information on the provision of elderly care in Iran. No specific policies targeting elderly people & Covid-19 found between Jan. 1 2020 and February 18th.     \"Policy-making is one identified challenge of the elderly care process in addition to access, technical infrastructure, integrity and coordination and lastly, health-based care services. In regards to access, there are no transportation facilities and many of the elderly are entirely stuck at home due to physical reasons or an inability to pay for transportation costs.    Also, 70 percent of elderly people in Iran are illiterate, which impacts their awareness of access to resources. Currently, Iran does not have the physical, human and informational resources to implement an elderly care policy. This is concerning as the country is projected to experience fast demographic changes and a huge increase in the elderly population in the near future.    The country does have community-based services for the elderly such as nursing homes, adult daycare centers, cultural centers and meals on wheels; unfortunately, the distribution is sparse and these services are intended for mainly elderly people with disabilities.\"    https://web.archive.org/web/20210218061505/https://borgenproject.org/time-for-action-elderly-care-in-iran/"

        "TEHRAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran will double the number of daily COVID-19 tests in the coming days, a senior medical official was quoted as saying by Press TV on Wednesday.    The number of daily tests will double, from the current 10,000 tests per day, to 20,000 to help authorities better deal with the disease outbreak, Alireza Biglari, head of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, was quoted as saying.    Biglari said that the number of labs carrying out tests for COVID-19 have also increased to a total of 90 recently across the country.    According to the report, several Iranian biomedicine companies have recently obtained certificates from health authorities to produce COVID-19 test kits on a commercial scale.    In producing the test kits, \"we are self-sufficient,\" Biglari added.    Iran's ministry of health on Wednesday reported a total number of 47,593 cases of novel coronavirus infection, of whom 3,036 have died.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200525202544/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-04/02/c_138939068.htm",
        "AC19 -- IRAN'S NATIONAL COVID-19 \"DETECTION\" APP  The app, which is named AC19, was released last week and was made available through a dedicated website, the official Play Store, and other third-party app stores.    The app was released while Iran is in the midst of a national health crisis, with the country being one of the most impacted countries in the world by the novel COVID-19 coronavirus.    After it's release, Iran's Health Ministry sent a mass SMS message to all Iranians urging them to install the app to check potential COVID-19 symptoms.    The app would let users register using their phone number and then ask Iranians to answer a series of questions related to coronavirus symptoms.    The idea was to let Iranians determine if they had severe symptoms, in order to prevent citizens from needlessly flooding local hospitals.    However, the app would also request access to real-time geo-location details, which it would immediately upload to a remote backend.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200525203044/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187764/"
