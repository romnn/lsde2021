In other words, with the country closed at home, because of the public health crisis caused by the Covid -19 pandemic, no company could cut electricity and gas in case of unpaid bills on the client side.

        "Portugal's parliament on Friday passed a bill which imposed the mandatory use of a mask on the street and public spaces in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus.    The order was passed a day after authorities reported 3,270 new coronavirus cases, the highest single-day increase since the beginning of the pandemic. It will be in effect for at least 70 days.    The use of a mask is compulsory for all people \"over ten years old to access, circulate or stay in public spaces and roads whenever the physical distance recommended by health authorities are impossible\", according to the bill.    The obligation between \"people from the same household, when they are not in the proximity of third parties\" can be waived or by means of a \"medical certificate\" that the clinical condition or cognitive impairment does not allow the use of masks.    It is also not mandatory to wear a mask when \"it is incompatible with the nature of the activities that people are carrying out.\"    Those who violate the order face fines of between 100 euros ($118) and 500 euros ($590). Other items such as visors will not be acceptable as substitutes.    The order will be reassessed following the expiry of the mandated period with a renewal a possibility.\"    These rules will be applied from Wednesday, October 28.\"    Sources: http://web.archive.org/web/20201028100351/https://newsaf.cgtn.com/news/2020-10-24/Portugal-s-Parliament-approves-mandatory-use-of-masks-in-outdoor-areas-UPMSI69oJy/index.html  http://web.archive.org/web/20201028100922/https://sicnoticias.pt/especiais/coronavirus/2020-10-27-A-partir-de-quarta-feira-vai-ter-de-usar-mascara-na-rua"

        "\u201c(\u2026) This Thursday, the Council of Ministers confirmed the new confinement, restoring the duty of home collection and determining the closure of a series of activities. Businesses in these sectors will have, according to the Prime Minister, automatic access to the simplified lay-off (\u2026) It should be noted that, since the beginning of July, the legislation dictates that only companies closed by legal or administrative imposition can access the extraordinary instrument in question. This condition meant that, in recent months, employers in crisis had to resort to alternative regimes, such as support for the progressive recovery (designed exactly to follow the simplified lay-off ).     (...) the Prime Minister made it clear that companies that want to remain in support of the progressive recovery can do so, now it remains to consider which of the options more advantageous .    The simplified lay-off is an exceptional financial support intended exclusively for the payment of remuneration, in periods of reduced working hours or suspension of employment contracts.  The support for progressive recovery is a support payment of wages only in periods of reduced hours work , that is, this scheme cannot suspend the labor contracts, although it is possible to reduce to 100% the normal period of work. It is important to point out, however, that in the simplified lay-off, employers can freely choose which cut to apply in the schedules or suspend contracts, while in support of the progressive resumption this decision is conditioned to the break in billing. For example, companies with cuts of at least 75% are the only ones that can reduce hours by 100%. And companies with cuts below 40% can only cut schedules by 33%. Companies with reductions of at least 40%, but less than 60%, can reduce the hours by 40% maximum. (\u2026) The support for the progressive recovery is available to all employers with cuts of at least 25%.     (\u2026) the Council of Ministers recently approved a diploma that determines that, both in the simplified lay-off and in the support of the progressive resumption , workers are entitled to 100% of their remuneration, up to 1,995 euros (three times the value of the national minimum wage), at no additional cost to the employer, compared to what has been required so far.    However, there are important differences in this payment to highlight. In the simplified lay-off, the employer is responsible for paying the hours worked, as well as 30% of the amount needed to, together with the first slice of remuneration, make up two thirds of the normal salary. In support of the progressive recovery , there are more nuances to take into account. In this regime, the employer also has to pay 100% of the hours worked, unless there are reductions equal to or greater than 75% . If so, employees can receive from Social Security a support equivalent to 35% of the salary for the hours worked.    There is also a difference from the simplified lay-off in compensation for hours not worked. In support of the gradual recovery, employers pay 30% of 80% of the compensation for hours not worked, with Social Security bearing the cost of the remaining amount (70%). In the event that the company chooses to cut working hours by more than 60% (which can only be done by employers who have reductions of at least 75%), the aforementioned compensation for unworked hours is ensured in full by Social Security .     (\u2026) With regards to social contributions , the simplified lay-off (\u2026) provides for the total exemption of all companies that adhere to this regime. In support of the progressive recovery, a 50% discount is foreseen, but only for micro, small and medium-sized companies and only with regard to compensation for hours not worked. Large companies pay must continue paying the social contributions of the workers, in both schemes.    In which scheme does the employee receives more?    If a worker who receives, for example, one thousand gross euros per month, under normal conditions, sees his contract suspended , under the simplified lay-off , he is entitled to earn, as of January 2021, the totality of that amount , which represents an expense of 200 euros for the company. In this situation, the employer is responsible for ensuring 30% of two thirds of those thousand euros (the 200 euros), while Social Security transfers the missing amount (800 euros) to the company. In this case, there is no place for social contributions, so the total expense of the employer is equivalent 200 euros .    (...) the simplified lay-off is preferable, but if the company that opted for supporting the progressive recovery is micro, small or medium size, this second regime will be the most advantageous . This is because, in support of the progressive recovery, these employers are entitled to a 50% discount on social contributions, which means that the expense for the job in question would rise to 118.75 euros , below the 200 euros of lay- simplified off .    What if the employer chooses to have workers work for a few hours ? (\u2026) If the referred worker with a salary of one thousand euros sees his schedule reduced by 50% , he is entitled, in both regimes, to one thousand euros of salary.    In the simplified lay-off , this amount is the result of the sum of 500 euros paid by the employer for the hours worked, with 50 euros paid by the company for the hours not worked, with the remaining 450 euros paid by the Social Security. In total, the employees spends 550 euros for this employer, since he does not have to pay social contributions.    In support of the recovery, the 1000\u20ac euros result from the sum of 500 euros paid for the hours worked (insured in full by the employer or in 65%, if there are reductions of at least 75%) with 500 euros paid for the hours not worked. , of which 120 euros insured by the employer (equivalent to 30% of 80% of hours not worked) and 380 euros supported by Social Security. The cost of the job for the employer is 857.5 euros (or 682.5 euros, if there is help for the hours worked), since the above mentioned expenses include social contributions.

Exceptional support to the family is extended to workers who are engaged in teleworking and choose to stop their activity to provide assistance to the family, in the following situations:   - single-parent family, during the custody period of the child or other dependent;   - the household includes at least one child or other dependent who is attending social equipment to support early childhood, a pre-school or primary school;   - the household includes at least one dependent with a disability, with a proven disability equal to or greater than 60%, regardless of age.
