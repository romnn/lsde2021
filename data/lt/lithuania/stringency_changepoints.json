It is advisable to wear them only in cases when social distance is not maintained in corridors and other general school spaces, it is difficult to control student flows, and the principle of class isolation is violated.    It is also recalled that primary school teachers also do not need to wear face shields. If it is possible to maintain a distance of at least 2 meters between the teacher and the students, teachers can work without protective equipment in grades 5-12. However, during lessons, when teachers counsel students, they move between students and do not maintain this distance - they should wear protective equipment covering their nose and mouth.    Regardless of distance, face shields must be worn by teachers of non-formal education for children, as students from different grades come together for these activities.
