Some countries have chosen to view face masks as a form of security and hope that universal use of face masks will reduce the risk of infection spreading from people who are in the incubation period, before the symptoms are apparent, or who have such mild or unspecific symptoms that they do not consider themselves ill. The Public Health Agency of Sweden does not recommend the general use of face masks, as a face mask that itches or slips down below the nose may mean a person is regularly touching their mouth, eyes or nose with their hands, which can increase the risk of the infection spreading. Use of a face mask may also encourage people with mild symptoms to go out into the community, which might increase the spread of infection. The Public Health Agency of Sweden is constantly assessing the state of knowledge in this area and reviews new information from various sources.\"    Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20200831175657/https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/prevention/"

        "For the period of 7 December until 6 January, the Public Health Agency has issued a 'recommendation' to close all high schools (gymnasieskolor - ages 16-19) for a month and move all classes online. This dose not include exams which cannot be taken at a distance. The temporary regulations give principals a certain flexibility to make decisions about their activities based on the current infection control situation or local needs. There are opportunities for the principal to take action if the school is open or if the school is or has been closed.  In line with the Interpretation Guide on C1, I have coded this as '2', since \"if the situation is that all schools are closed ... then that would count as a full closure\". Since principals have the authority to decide whether to close high-schools, depending on the regional situation, and this is only a recommendation - making it unlikely for upper-secondary schools to close countrywide - a Targeted flag has been selected.  http://web.archive.org/web/20201207153005/https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/27a3b8becacc47edbfa51273b4931886/beslut-2020-12-03-rekommendation-om-delvis-stangning-och-overgang-till-fjarr-eller-distansundervisning-gymnasieskolan.pdf http://web.archive.org/web/20201207154159/https://www.skolverket.se/regler-och-ansvar/coronaviruset-och-covid-19---regler-for-skolor-och-forskolor/regler-for-forskolor-och-skolor-som-ar-oppna-stangda-eller-varit-stangda-under-coronapandemin"

The tax reduction is aimed at people with low and medium incomes and is granted at a maximum of SEK 2 250 per year. A phasing-in of the reduction starts at incomes above SEK 60 000 per year and the tax reduction is completely phased out at incomes of SEK 500 000 per year. The proposal is proposed to enter into force on 1 December 2021 and is given for the entire tax years 2021 and 2022.    http://web.archive.org/web/20210531153218/https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2021/05/forslag-om-tillfallig-skattereduktion-for-att-hantera-okade-arbetskostnader-till-foljd-av-pandemin"

They must have clear signage that clarifies for visitors how many people may visit the premises at the same time.

The size of a dining party allowed to sit at one table is limited to 8 people. If a party is larger, they must be divided between several tables with at least one metre between them.  Venues serving food and drink have to implement hygiene measures incl the prevention of crowding.     Businesses with premises that are so large that they can let in 500 or more customers or visitors should perform a special risk assessment to determine whether there is a risk of crowding in the business premises, parts of the premises or close to the premises. The businesses should take special infection control measures to reduce the risk of crowding in such places.     Fairs are now regulated in the same way as markets. This means e.g. that the trade fair organizer must inform its visitors and exhibitors about how the spread of infection can be avoided and design corridors between the points of sale or the stands so that congestion is avoided. The provision contains general advice that the organizer should assign the exhibitors a place with a distance of at least 2 meters sideways and backwards and for longer distances in the corridors. Those who organize a trade fair that covers special risks from the point of view of infection control should make a special risk assessment and take special measures to reduce the risk of the spread of infection, for example at a lecture, when people are in a place for a long time.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074016/https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/tillsynsvagledning-for-verksamheter/    https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074022/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/current-rules-and-recommendations",

Venues serving food and drink have to implement hygiene measures incl the prevention of crowding.     Businesses with premises that are so large that they can let in 500 or more customers or visitors should perform a special risk assessment to determine whether there is a risk of crowding in the business premises, parts of the premises or close to the premises. The businesses should take special infection control measures to reduce the risk of crowding in such places.     Fairs are now regulated in the same way as markets. This means e.g. that the trade fair organizer must inform its visitors and exhibitors about how the spread of infection can be avoided and design corridors between the points of sale or the stands so that congestion is avoided. The provision contains general advice that the organizer should assign the exhibitors a place with a distance of at least 2 meters sideways and backwards and for longer distances in the corridors. Those who organize a trade fair that covers special risks from the point of view of infection control should make a special risk assessment and take special measures to reduce the risk of the spread of infection, for example at a lecture, when people are in a place for a long time.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074016/https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/tillsynsvagledning-for-verksamheter/    https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074022/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/current-rules-and-recommendations",

        "22nd July 2021, Inbound journeys to Sweden from abroad    For Swedish citizen:    The Public Health Agency of Sweden recommends that those who have traveled outside the Nordic region take a PCR test when returning to Sweden. This applies even if you do not have any symptoms.   When returning from countries for which UD has issued a travel advisory, the Public Health Agency's recommendation regarding testing and isolation applies for one week after arrival in Sweden.  Fully vaccinated individuals without symptoms are exempt from the recommendation of testing and isolation after arrival in Sweden regardless of which country they have been in.  Note: These rules also apply to foreign nationals who are registered residents in Sweden or who live in Sweden with a valid residence permit, right of residence or residence status.    For foreign national from the EU/EEA:    In order to travel into Sweden, foreign nationals travelling from an EU/EEA country need to have a Covid certificate, a negative Covid-19 test no more than 72 hours old or proof of a return to health. The Covid certificate shows that a person has been tested negative, has been vaccinated against, or recovered from Covid-19. This will apply until 31 August 2021.     Inbound journeys are allowed no later than 72 hours after a negative test result or 14 days after a first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine. A certificate showing a return to health from SARS-CoV-2 infection allows an inbound journey at the earliest 11 days after a positive test. The certificate can be digital or on paper. It has to be issued in the issuing country's official language and English. A separate certificate should be issued for every vaccination, test result, or proof of a return to health. The certificate must include details about the person's identity, which vaccine they've been given, and how many shots they have had.  Exceptions are made for foreign nationals who are registered residents in Sweden or who live in Sweden with a valid residence permit, right of residence or residence status. For these, the same rules apply as for Swedish citizens.  The requirement for a negative Covid-19 test, recoviery or vaccination does not apply if you travel from Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway.  The requirements apply to everyone who is 18 years or older, and not to children.  The Public Health Agency of Sweden recommends that those who have traveled outside the Nordic region take a PCR test when returning to Sweden. This applies even if you do not have any symptoms.   When you arrive from countries covered by travel advisories from the Swedish Ministry of foreign affairs (\"UD\"), the Public Health Agency's recommendation regarding testing and isolation applies for one week after arrival in Sweden.  Read more about what rules and recommendations apply to foreign nationals on the Police website.     For a foreign national from a country outside the EU/EEA    There is a ban on non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EU/EEA. The ban applies to foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA and will remain in effect until 31 August 2021. Certain individuals who have particularly urgent needs or who are going to carry out essential services in Sweden may be exempt.  Foreign nationals who fulfil the requirements for an exemption are advised to get tested for Covid-19 when they arrive in Sweden and five days after their arrival. They should also self-isolate for one week after arriving in Sweden.     A number of countries are exempt from the entry ban. The decisive factor is whether you live in one of the countries, not if you are a citizen. Travellers to Sweden should therefore be prepared to provide documentation showing that they live in one of the aforementioned countries in order to be granted entry.  Exempted travellers need to show results from a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old before entry.  Currently exempt countries: Australia, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Israel, Japan. In addition, from 30 June 2021, those living in one of the following countries will also be allowed to enter Sweden: Albania, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macao, North Macedonia, Serbia, Taiwan, and the USA.    Foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA can enter Sweden from EU/EEA countries if they can present a certificate proving a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old. This requirement does not apply if you travel from Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210714080804/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/travel-restrictions"

The risk of infection is lower when you socialise outdoors, but remember to maintain a safe distance from others;  - avoid places like shops and caf\u00e9s where many people gather;  - avoid travelling on public transport such as buses, trams and the Metro.
