Exporters\u2019 inventory financing is being supported by extending maturities for existing and new export rediscount credits. A second package of CBRT measures (March 31) allowed for an increase in outright purchases of sovereign bonds, and broadened the pool of assets for use as collateral in CBRT transactions. A third package of measures of CBRT increased the upper limit for CBRT\u2019s funding through Open Market Operations and regulated the primary dealer banks outright sovereign bond sales to the CBRT to maintain market depth, strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism and support the Primary Dealership system. The bank regulator announced forbearance measures, primarily to limit the accounting impact of TL depreciation and fall in securities\u2019 prices. The LTV limit on mortgages was raised from 80 to 90 percent. The minimum payment for individual credit cards was reduced to 20 percent, and banks postponed repayments on credit card loans for housing, consumer and vehicle purchases. Bank regulator implemented a new regulatory ratio incentivizing banks support for the real economy and government financing Public banks granted firms affected by the crisis a 3-month moratorium on bank loan repayments (principal and interest). Debt enforcement and bankruptcy proceedings (except in alimony cases) have been suspended. Firms\u2019 dividend payments limited to 25 percent of 2019 profits. Exporters will be provided with inventory financing, and reimbursement of rediscount credits have been extended by 90 days.    On May 20, the CBRT announced that the overall limit of the bilateral swap agreement between Turkey and Qatar was increased from US$ 5 billion to US$ 15 billion equivalent. On May 29 the BRSA amended the calculation of the Asset Ratio (AR), imposed on banks to be effective as of May to encourage domestic lending through long term funding.  On June 1, Public deposit banks Ziraat Bank, Halkbank and Vakifbank launched new retail loan campaigns for house purchases and consumer spending. On June 3, the withholding tax on returns from FX mutual funds was raised to 15 percent from 10 percent for real persons and zero for legal persons, and the Capital Markets Board (SPK) imposed some limitations on the portfolio composition of FX mutual funds. On June 5, the CBRT announced the reallocation of TL 20 billion of the TL 60 billion TL rediscount credit facility for exporters towards advance loans for investment in support strategic projects. On June 9, BRSA raised the upper limit on instalment plans for credit card purchases of services from airlines, travel agencies and hotels to 18 months from 12 months.

The country plans to gradually ensure a return to school for millions of students in the coming weeks, based on the course of progress.    Strict measures aimed at preventing further infections are expected to allow for further reopening following the closure of schools since March. Fearing a serious gap in education, Turkey decided to join other countries for a reopening that was originally scheduled for Aug. 31. A heightened caseload, however, forced a postponement until Sept. 21.    The reopening week saw kindergarten and first-grade students arrive for just one day and two days of classes the following. Meanwhile, the number of students in each classroom has been reduced with separate school hours for students. Every class lasts only 30 minutes, with 10-minute breaks in between.

        "\"Students of five more grades returned to school under tight measures on Monday as Turkey strives to keep schools open in a bid to improve education amid the coronavirus outbreak.    A few weeks after kindergartners and first-graders started in-person classes, second, third, fourth, eighth and 12th graders were back to school. It is part of a government scheme that is based on a trial and error basis on coronavirus trends.    In parallel with the improvement in the situation, authorities have been gradually rolling out new in-person education programs. Like other grades which started earlier, new grades will attend classes only two days a week while they will attend live online classes for the rest of the week.    The two days a week scheme allows for reducing the number of students per classroom. Every classroom will have half of its original capacity only, with a group of students going to school on Monday and Tuesday and others attending on Thursday and Friday. Every student is seated alone at their desks.\"    Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20201022145014/https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/education/millions-back-to-school-as-in-person-education-expands-amid-pandemic-in-turkey",

        "On 15 December, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan annouced that the government will provide the tradespeople with nearly TL 5 billion (USD 637,989,739.04) worth of support for three months.    The shop owners negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can benefit from the financial support that will see the government paying TL 1,000 for three months to nearly 1.24 million people, including 806,871 citizens and 432,657 shop owners who are directly affected by the lockdowns.    The money will be extended as a grant and businesses such as taxi, midibus and service vehicle managers, bazaar vendors, tailors, auto mechanics, hostels, dorms and kindergartens will benefit from it.    In metropolitan cities, shop owners will be given TL 750 worth of rent support, while other cities will receive TL 500.    \u201cWithin the framework of these two support items, we plan to provide a total of TL 5 billion of grant support to our tradesmen over the next three months,\u201d Erdogan said.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210215215003/https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkish-governments-support-to-help-ease-burden-on-tradespeople-curb-losses"

        "In terms of economic support, the government doesn't give any support to those who lost their jobs. But those who normally work but because of the covid-19, the firms cannot pay them, for those people there were two options Cash payment support and short-time working allowance/work.     First is Cash payment support which is given to workers who are currently in unpaid time-off (due to covid-19, firms cannot fire the employers, so they are sending their workers to unpaid time-off). In one month its max pay time is 30 days and the daily wage is 47.70 TRY (The currency is changing rapidly in these weeks, so to avoid the wrong amount, I didn't write in USD form). This support is ending on 05/17/2021 if there won't be any extension.     The second way is a short-time working allowance/work. In this payment, the workers who are currently working (who are not in time-off or any other absence situation) and be approved by the Turkish Employment Agency are getting %60 of their daily gross earnings. This support ended on 03/31/2021 but within the new presidential decree, it extended to 06/30/2021.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210122131003/https://www.iskur.gov.tr/isveren/kisa-calisma-odenegi/genel-bilgiler/ https://web.archive.org/web/20210122191037/https://www.iskur.gov.tr/is-arayan/issizlik-sigortasi/nakdi-ucret-destegi/ https://web.archive.org/web/20210325135853/https://www.cnnturk.com/ekonomi/nakdi-ucret-destegi-ne-zaman-bitiyor-ucretsiz-izin-maas-destegi-ne-zaman-bitecek   http://web.archive.org/web/20210422214717/https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/resmi-gazetede-yayimlanan-kararla-kisa-calisma-odenegi-3-ay-sureyle-uzatildi-1830299",

But those who normally work but because of the covid-19, the firms cannot pay them, for those people there were two options Cash payment support and short-time working allowance/work.     First is Cash payment support which is given to workers who are currently in unpaid time-off (due to covid-19, firms cannot fire the employers, so they are sending their workers to unpaid time-off). In one month its max pay time is 30 days and the daily wage is 47.70 TRY (The currency is changing rapidly in these weeks, so to avoid the wrong amount, I didn't write in USD form). This support is ending on 05/17/2021 if there won't be any extension.     The second way is a short-time working allowance/work. In this payment, the workers who are currently working (who are not in time-off or any other absence situation) and be approved by the Turkish Employment Agency are getting %60 of their daily gross earnings.
