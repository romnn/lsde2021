        "\"Schools started to reopen in late May. On May 18th, few days after the government announced the end of the epidemic measures to be scheduled for June 1st, primary schools opened again for pupils of first three grades, but still under strict safety regulations. Classes were split in half and all communication between pupils of different classes was to be prevented, while teachers had to wear protective masks at all times. Secondary schools also reopened, but only for 4th grade students who started preparing for matura exams, divided into smaller groups. Kindergartens also reopened, but children were organized in smaller groups in strict prevention measures were observed. On May 25, primary school 9th grade pupils returned to school. After lots of criticism about this partial reopening while all other lockdown measures were being lifted, the Ministry of Education announced on May 28 that 4th and 5th grade primary school pupils will return to school on June 1, while the remaining 6th, 7th and 8th grade students would follow two days later on June 3. Secondary school students would finish this school year via distance learning and would not return to school.\" This remains until the beginning of the new school year on September 1, 2020.   http://web.archive.org/web/20200824024929/https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/measures-to-contain-the-spread-of-covid-19-infections/",

        "At today's correspondence session, the Government adopted a proposal for the Intervention Measures Act to mitigate and eliminate the consequences of COVID-19 or the so-called fifth anti-crown package.    The bill for employees extends the measure of 100 percent compensation of salary in the case of ordered quarantine due to contact with an infected person at work. From 1 September 2020 onwards, it will be possible to claim 80% compensation in the event of absence from work due to child protection due to force majeure (child quarantine).  For employers, the possibility of reimbursing compensation for wages paid for absence from work due to the ordered quarantine is extended. In addition, they are relieved of the possibility of reimbursement of salary compensation due to absence from work due to childcare (force majeure).  The press release issued by the government late last night indicated no major changes to the previous version of the bill, which entails measures for healthcare, labour, social security, economy, education, justice, criminal sanctions, agriculture and infrastructure. Previous policies still in place with the fifth package, hence 1A maintained. https://web.archive.org/web/20201001180911/https://www.gov.si/novice/2020-09-29-98-dopisna-seja-vlade-republike-slovenije/ https://web.archive.org/web/20201001185704/https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/news/7057-morning-headlines-for-slovenia"

        "The government of Slovenia maintains a color-coded system of entry / quarantine restrictions:  A very small number of countries are designated \u201cgreen\u201d (epidemiologically safe).  A much larger list of countries, including the United States, are designated as \u201cred\u201d (poor epidemiological conditions).  In some cases, regions of countries are listed as \u201cred.\u201d  All non-listed countries/regions of countries  are designated \u201corange\u201d (aggravated epidemiological situation).   Travelers who have spent 14 days in either a \u201cgreen\u201d country or an \u201corange\u201d EU country/region can enter Slovenia without quarantine.  All others must quarantine 10 days or have a negative result from a Covid test taken in the EU within the prior 48 hours.

        "The Government issued the Ordinance on temporary suspension of the sale of goods and services to consumers in the Republic of Slovenia, which enters into force on 9 January 2021 and will apply until 15 January 2021.    To restrict the movement of people and contain and manage the COVID-19 epidemic, a new Ordinance on the temporary suspension of the sale of goods and services to consumers in the Republic of Slovenia is proposed, which temporarily prohibits the offering and sale of goods and services directly to consumers in the Republic of Slovenia with certain exceptions that are necessary to meet citizens\u2019 basic needs or are important for ensuring safety and health.    Some businesses are closed while some remain open, including hairdressing services.    https://archive.vn/vWP8z",
        "At midnight on Saturday, 9 January, an amendment to the ordinance on state border crossing will enter into force, which will introduce the option to prove that a person does not have COVID-19 with both rapid antigen tests and PCR tests. When entering the Republic of Slovenia, negative PCR tests are required in case of arrival from third countries, which must not be older than 48 hours. Rapid antigen tests are valid only if done in the EU or the Schengen Area.     Testing with rapid antigen tests at border crossings has been abolished on the external Schengen border. The five border crossings and the Jo\u017ee Pucnik Airport that have been offering rapid tests will therefore no longer continue to do so.    Anyone who does not present this proof will have to go into quarantine, which can, however, be lifted if the person takes a test within five days of the decision being issued.     Finland is removed from the red list, which means that entry from this country is possible without quarantine or a negative test. There are no changes in the list of third countries.    https://archive.vn/vWP8z  https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170450/https://www.gov.si/en/news/2021-01-07-the-governments-priorities-are-citizens-health-and-safety-the-pupils-of-the-first-three-grades-of-primary-school-and-the-full-opening-of-kindergartens/"

The use of protective masks is mandatory for pupils in grades 6 to 9, the staff and secondary school students, while pupils in grades 1 to 5 must wear masks in common areas and when moving through the school.

Both PCR and rapid tests are deemed sufficient if performed in an EU Member State, a Schengen Area country, Australia, Israel, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, Serbia, the UK or the US, at check points on flight connections of international air transport, and in Turkey.
