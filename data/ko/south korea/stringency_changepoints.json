        " \"A total of 336 schools in South Korea have temporarily shut down or postponed the start of the new semester due to fears of the spread of the new coronavirus, government data showed Monday.    According to the Ministry of Education, 245 kindergartens, 53 elementary schools, 21 middle schools, 16 high schools and one special education school nationwide have halted school operations or delayed reopening after winter vacation as of 9 a.m. as part of emergency measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.    Elementary and secondary schools here usually restart in the last week of January or the first week of February after a month-long winter vacation.    (...) The ministry decided over the weekend to allow schools in areas presumed to be vulnerable to the viral disease, or where a confirmed case is reported or a carrier is found to have traveled, to choose temporary closure after prior consultations with regional educational authorities.    In Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul, educational authorities in Suwon and Bucheon ordered all kindergartens and elementary and secondary schools in their jurisdiction to close for a week.    Authorities in Goyang, also in Gyeonggi Province, recommended closures for all its kindergartens for one week.    In Seoul, a total of nine schools, including three elementary schools, two middle schools and three high schools, remained closed as of Monday morning.    In Gunsan, a North Jeolla Province city where a confirmed case of the new coronavirus was reported, all kindergartens and elementary and secondary schools were ordered shut for two weeks.\"    Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20200330180640/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/weeks-of-school-closure-in-south-korea-a-home-based-working-mums-nightmare"

        "\"With the final batch of students returning to classes Monday, South Korea completed its phased school reopening scheme despite growing anxiety over a second wave of new coronavirus infections in Seoul and adjacent cities.    About 1.35 million more students -- in the first grade of middle school and the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school -- went back to their classrooms in the final round of the government's four-phased reopening plan, which started with high-school seniors on May 20.      (...) But only one-third or two-thirds of them will actually be attending classes, with schools set to mix schedules for in-person classes and remote learning due to limited space for keeping a distance among students.    South Korea began reopening schools weeks after the country switched its social distancing campaign to what it calls an \"everyday life quarantine\" scheme aimed at helping the people slowly return to life under eased rules.    (...) Of the total, 33 cases were local transmissions, all in the capital area where cluster infections traced to religious gatherings, nightclubs, a distribution center and a door-to-door business entity have stoked alarm.    (...) Even as the school resumption completed, 14 schools in Jungnang Ward in eastern Seoul were forced to resume remote learning after a high school student in the area tested positive for the virus after visiting Lotte World Adventure, an amusement park in the city, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.\"    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20201125215336/https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200605008451315"

        "\"South Korea's education ministry on Sunday said it will ease attendance caps for schools after health authorities decided to enforce the lowest level of social distancing measures.    Schools around the nation are required to operate with antivirus limits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, attendance is capped at one-third in elementary and middle schools, and two-thirds in high schools.    But starting Oct. 19, the attendance cap for all schools will be set at two-thirds, Seoul's education ministry said.    (...) The latest move is in line with health authorities' decision to lower the country's social distancing scheme to Level 1 from Monday in the three-tier system.    Schools that have small classroom populations and are located in regions with relatively small virus caseloads can further ease the cap to accommodate more students, the ministry said. However, schools in the greater Seoul area and have big classroom population are strictly required to follow the cap.    The ministry said schools can decide their class operation schedules depending on their situation, and can expand in-class activities by staggering school hours, or running different time tables for each class. Such eased rules will allow some schools to have full-time in-class activities daily, according to the ministry.\"    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20201125223711/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20201011000252"
