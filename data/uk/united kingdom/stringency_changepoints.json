        "\u201cOn Friday, the WHO updated their guidance on face coverings, advising that they should be considered in settings where maintaining social distancing is difficult. However, to be crystal clear, wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing or washing your hands regularly.    \u201cFurther scientific evidence is needed on the benefits to the wider public of wearing face coverings, but observational findings so far suggest that homemade or purchased 3 layer face-coverings might reduce transmission from one person to another if made, worn, handled and disposed of properly.    \u201cTherefore, on balance, we are recommending to the people of Wales that 3 layer face-coverings should be used in situations where social distancing measures can be more difficult to achieve, for example, on public transport. We are not recommending their use outdoors.    \u201cThe wearing of face coverings will not be mandatory, but we will encourage people to do this for the benefit of themselves and others.\"  https://web.archive.org/web/20201005051938/https://gov.wales/3-layer-face-coverings-recommended-not-mandatory-certain-situations-wales"

The government has delivered an unprecedented package of support to councils over recent months, and councils in England will now receive a further, unringfenced \u00a3500 million to respond to spending pressures they are facing.    Recognising that councils are best placed to decide how to meet pressures in their local area, this funding has not been ringfenced.

The following businesses and venues in England are due to reopen from 25 July, as outlined in the table below with links to guidance to ensure their safe opening: Indoor fitness and dance studios, Indoor gyms, Indoor sports courts and facilities, Indoor swimming pools and indoor water parks. So as of 22 July, some sectors are still closed in England. In the city of Leicester, which is under a stricter lockdown due to a rise in cases, most businesses are closed, though cafes and restaurants can operate takeaway services.

Therefore, the coding is upgraded to 4G on review.   It should be noted, however, that technically not ALL private gatherings are reduced to a level 4 due to Wales allowing outdoor gatherings of slightly bigger groups. On rainy days, of which Wales has a considerable amount, outdoor gatherings outside of someones gardens (for which the rule of six applies even outside) are somewhat unlikely and a coding of 4 is therefore appropriate. https://web.archive.org/web/20201004213732/https://gov.wales/guidance-leaving-your-home-and-seeing-other-people-coronavirus (Wales) https://web.archive.org/web/20201004214002/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51506729 (England) https://web.archive.org/web/20201004214404/https://www.irishpost.com/news/rule-of-six-how-todays-new-social-gathering-restrictions-affect-you-192812 (NI) (Scotland in previous sources)",
