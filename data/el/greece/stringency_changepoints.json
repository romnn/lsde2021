        "Greek health authorities are urging the country\u2019s residents to wear a mask at all times particularly in public spaces where contact with others is inevitable in efforts to keep the spread of Covid-19 in check.    As the government prepares to start easing restrictions on movement next week, Health Ministry spokesman Sotiris Tsiodras underlined the importance of wearing face masks in closed public areas to avert the spread of the coronavirus and said health authorities are working on an infomercial with instructions on how to make them. The use of masks on public transport is particularly important, Tsiodras said, noting that the use of surgical masks is not necessary and home-made masks, made of either paper or fabric, are also effective, in line with European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines.     https://web.archive.org/web/20201018160429/https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/04/28/citizens-required-to-wear-masks-in-public-sotiris-tsiodras/  https://web.archive.org/web/20200609172454/https://news.gtp.gr/2020/04/29/greece-sets-face-mask-rule-contain-covid-19-spread/  https://web.archive.org/web/20200609071246/https://www.ekathimerini.com/252245/article/ekathimerini/news/advice-on-use-of-face-masks-against-covid-19"

        "It was decided by the Government to reopen the kindergartens, primary and special education schools of all levels from Monday, June 1, 2020.    This decision was based on the following factors:    First and foremost, in the unanimous proposal of the Public Health Emergency Management Committee by Infectious Diseases for the reopening of these school structures. This suggestion is certainly linked to the steadily declining course of the epidemic, with children having a harder time transmitting and transmitting the virus, and now that the temperature is rising, the safest time to open schools is epidemiologically. Since the beginning of this health crisis, we have had the privilege of being guided by an excellent team of experts, whose recommendations we follow with very good, internationally recognized results. So we go now, and we thank them warmly.  The overall de-escalation of measures has been very positive. As for schools, the previous experience of opening high schools and lyceums is very encouraging. The protection and prevention measures are modeled on the members of the educational community and everything has gone extremely smoothly.  We must ensure the return of all students to their physical space, which is none other than school. The long absence from school hinders their learning process, their spiritual, social, mental development. Primary school students are already out of school for almost 3 months, and would have been there for a total of 6 months if the schools had not been opened now. There can be no regularity without open schools.  Children are safer in school, where they follow rules and follow protection and prevention measures, rather than in neighborhoods and squares without rules. There is no better place than school to adapt and get children used to the new reality. To learn to pay more attention to every aspect of their daily lives.  Open schools reduce social inequalities and empower children from more vulnerable family backgrounds. Students who do not have modern technological equipment, students who experience tension in their family environment, students of the smallest mainly classes who do not have family guidance for distance education.  Regarding special schools, students attending these schools have a special need to be back in their school environment, with their teachers and classmates. And they obviously need it for their learning development but also for their psycho-emotional and social development.  I now turn to how these educational structures reopen:    Regarding primary and secondary schools, they will reopen on Monday, June 1. Classes will be extended until Friday, June 26 (instead of June 15), while for teachers as a whole, the end of the school year will be June 30. For substitute teachers, their contracts will be extended until June 30.  School and kindergarten departments will operate with up to 15 students at a time and with a distance of 1.5 meters on the desks, which will have the same orientation. If the students exceed 15, then the department will be divided into 2 sub-departments, and will operate in rotation, Monday-Wednesday-Friday one, Tuesday-Thursday the other, and next week the opposite. If the students do not exceed 15, then the class will be open daily.  There will be antiseptics in the rooms, cleaning is provided twice a day, both during and after school. Special legislation and additional funds have been provided for the amendment of the contracts of the cleaning staff, as well as the possibility for the recruitment of additional cleaning staff. We thank the Ministry of Interior and the Municipalities for the excellent cooperation in this area.  Breaks are provided at different times to reduce congestion, and canteens are not allowed to operate.  Natural ventilation of the rooms is provided, the use of the mask is optional for teachers and students (both at school and on school buses), special EODY instructions will be sent in the coming days to all primary education structures, and a significant part of the first day will be dedicated to explanation of these instructions. There is a special concern for teachers who fall into the category of special leave of absence as defined by the Ministry of Interior. There is also the possibility of a student being absent, on the basis of a simple responsible statement from a parent or guardian about the existence of a person in the home who belongs to an increased risk group or who is ill.  There is the possibility of modern distance learning by teachers for those students who fall into categories that justify their absence.  For the time being, all-day schools will not be open.  For special schools: they will reopen on June 1st to June 12th for secondary school and until June 26th for primary school. The competent subcommittee of infectious diseases specialists is meeting today to give special instructions for the reopening of the special education units. There will be strict protection measures    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618002455/https://www.minedu.gov.gr/news/45093-25-05-20-omilia-tis-ypourgoy-paideias-thriskevmaton-nikis-kerameos-gia-ta-dimotika-sxoleia-kai-nipiagogeia-2",

        "MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  While Greece is not eligible to additional asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion until end-2020 under the existing APP from the ECB, Greece is eligible for other ECB monetary support measures, including temporary additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) from June 2020 through June 2021. Greece is also eligible for the new liquidity facility (PELTRO), which consists of a series of non-targeted Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations carried out with an interest rate that is 25bp below the average MRO rate prevailing over the life of the operation. Further measures by the ECB for which Greece is eligible include an additional \u20ac1.350 billion asset purchase program of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP) until at least June-2021 and the corresponding maturing principal payments will be reinvested until at least end-2022. In addition, Greece is eligible for an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs).    The ECB Banking Supervision is allowing significant institutions to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical buffer by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital relief measures. The ECB Banking Supervision entity, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) further decided to exercise \u2013 on a temporary basis \u2013 flexibility in the classification requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public moratoria; and recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical assumptions for the determination of loss provisions. Furthermore, the ECB recommends that banks opt for the IFRS9 transitional rules.    Banks will allow deferral of principal payments on existing loans for hard-hit individuals and firms through end-September (in addition to the interest payment subsidies mentioned above).    http://archive.fo/Vv7jQ",

On November 5, the government extended selected support measures in parallel to the imposition of new movement restrictions.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201209193521/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Those employed in industries that involve direct contact with large numbers of people, such as tourism and catering, will need to take two COVID-19 rapid tests a week.    Workers will need to upload their test results to the relevant government website and carry printed proof of a negative test to be allowed admission to their workplaces. Persons who test positive will receive further instructions on additional testing and self-isolation. The new regulation will also allow employers to demand proof of vaccination from employees who work in close proximity to other staff. Authorities have indicated that the cost of rapid tests will be set at EUR 10.    /web/20210919211330/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/517001/greece-authorities-plan-to-tighten-domestic-covid-19-restrictions-starting-sept-13-update-71"
