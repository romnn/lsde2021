        "Press statements by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban:    Dear Romanians, I felt it is my obligation to make today this statement. Today we registered the largest single-day COVID-19 caseload - 555 Romanians who were declared positive after being diagnosed. Over the last four weeks, we registered an increase in the number of cases from week to week.    Unlike other countries, in Romania, the Government I am leading, had an approach of the gradual relaxation measures, with restrictions lifting phases, relaxation measures phases, once with opening the activities that have been under restriction in various phases, following increased interaction between people, we witnessed an increase in the number of cases from week to week.  I conclude by conveying a message to every Romanian: The virus does not forgive anyone, nor does it forgive those who do not believe in the existence of the virus. If someone overlooks the rules, neglects and exposes himself to illness, when he becomes ill he not only endangers himself, he also endangers his loved ones, family members, relatives, colleagues, and friends.    When you get sick you risk getting your loved ones sick as you may transmit the virus to those you are most often in close contact with. If you don't care about your health and you don't believe in this virus or you think this virus is not dangerous, please care about your brother, your mother, your father, your child, your friends, your colleagues. Only together, in solidarity and respecting simple rules, established by specialists, those who know very well how to fight against this virus, only together can we bring things back to normal and fight the epidemic effectively. I am confident that every Romanian will understand this watershed moment and will understand that success in the fight against the epidemic will solely depend on responsible and correct behaviour towards fellow citizens. Thank you!    Link: http://archive.vn/S8uM1",
