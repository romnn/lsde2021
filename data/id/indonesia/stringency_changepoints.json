        "Different regions in Indonesia are undergoing a patchwork of PSBBs (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar, eng: Large-scale social restrictions (LSSR)). These take on the form of transitionary and proportional.  Note: these restrictions are not as broad and not necessarily as strict as the PSBBs employed in the country in early 2020 (Apr and May).    In general: acc to the US Embassy in Indonesia: \"While the government has lifted most restrictions regarding transit and daily activity, measures remain in place limiting large-scale gatherings and non-essential travel.\" https://web.archive.org/web/20201206224550/https://id.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/    Specific PSBB reports:  1. Banten Province: Proportional PSBB from Nov 20 to Dec 19, 2020 https://web.archive.org/web/20201206225136/https://republika.co.id/berita/qk2sxu484/psbb-di-provinsi-banten-diperpanjang-hingga-19-desember  2.

Jakarta: Transitional PSBB extended till Dec 06: https://web.archive.org/web/20201206234145/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/11/23/jakarta-extends-transitional-psbb-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-health-protocol-violations.html    While not as universal and strict as the nation-wide PSBB employed by Indonesia in early 2020, these local patchwork of PSBBs give authorities to enact strict restrictions on public gatherings, workplace restrictions, including mass public prayers without any prior notice (restrictions can range from requiring social distancing ... to ... shutting down work places in select sectors).   The details of how strict such restrictions are at any given moment are under-reported. Below are examples of the most strictest restrictions i could find from such PSBBs, which have now been extended:    Example 1: Oct 27 2020; Jakarta Post: \"Large-scale social restrictions in Bodebek, Jakarta extended\"   Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20201101073623/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/27/large-scale-social-restrictions-in-bodebek-jakarta-extended.html    \"Depok city (in West Java province) is the region with the highest number of COVID-19 cases with a total of 6,858 patients. Depok is now also classified as a red zone after the national COVID-19 task force upgraded its status as a region with a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, the Depok administration will continue to impose a curfew for residents and business activities. With the curfew, residents\u2019 activities cannot continue past 9 p.m., while businesses are allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. \"Dine-ins at restaurants and food stalls will only be allowed until 6 p.m., while take away service is until 9:00 p.m.,\" said Depok city COVID-19 task force spokesperson, Dadang Wihana.\"    Example 2: The international legal blog/website Lexology.com reported on Sep 09 2020: \"Jakarta Government Pulls the Emergency Brake and Reinstates Total Large-Scale Social Restrictions\"; Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20201206231657/https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=43457a21-1aed-4665-9057-0a4d9ee12d48    While this is not a news/govt agency, this article was the best example I could spot for what included in more recently enacted PSBBs in Indonesia:    \"1. Non-essential office activities must be done from home. The governor of Jakarta emphasized that business actors should continue their business activities from home, not in the office.    2. Businesses in the 11 essential sectors stipulated in Jakarta Governor Regulation No. 33 of 2020 on the Implementation of Large-Scale Social Restrictions to Handle the Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Jakarta (as amended) can remain open with minimum operation. These 11 essential sectors are as follows: a) health; b) food and beverages; c) energy; \fd) communication and informatics technology; e) financial; f) logistics; g) hotels; h) construction; i) strategic industries (not specifically defined, so the Jakarta Governor has the discretion to further stipulate it) j) essential services (pelayanan dasar), public utilities and certain industries that are categorized as national vital objects (obyek vital nasional) and certain objects (obyek tertentu); k) daily necessity supplies (kebutuhan sehari-hari)    3. Business actors that have obtained a non-essential exceptional operational license (izin pengecualian operasi bidang non-esensial) must re-obtain the license from the government of Jakarta.    4. All entertainment/recreation, including malls (except daily needs stores in the malls), museums, zoos and public parks will be closed.    5. Students will continue to learn from home as schools remain closed.    6. Restaurants and cafes can continue to operate, but only to serve take-away and delivery orders (no dine-in service).    7. Local places of worship (that only serve people in the neighborhood) can still operate, but with strict protocols and provided that they are not located in red zones. Big/renowned worship places (that serve people from all over Jakarta) must be closed.    8. Activities that can gather a crowd, e.g., reunions and large family gatherings, must not be held.    9. Public transportation will be limited (in the number of vehicles and the time). In Jakarta, the odd and even private cars restrictions will temporarily be stopped.    10. The governor of Jakarta urges people to stay at home and not leave Jakarta unless there is an urgent need. Further, the Jakarta government is coordinating with the central government and the neighboring regional governments, such as Banten, to discuss the limitation of vehicles going in and out of Jakarta.\"",
