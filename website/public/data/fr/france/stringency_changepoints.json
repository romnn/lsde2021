        "\"After weeks of official statements saying it was not necessary to wear a mask unless you were sick or worked in the medical profession, France's Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine (Academy of Medicine) announced Friday that a mask should be compulsory during outings both during and after the current lockdown.   The French government quickly followed with an announcement that the manufacture of non-medical \"alternative\" masks to be used by the public would be ramped up and, the next day, said it had ordered 2 billion face masks from China.  The reversal came after media reports \u2013 notably by investigative news site Mediapart and state-run TV France 2 \u2013 that the government\u2019s early insistence that face masks were not useful was, in fact, prompted by a shortage of them.  (...) But even before that, the French government was giving mixed signals. While officially maintaining that face masks were unnecessary for people without symptoms or who are not caring for coronavirus sufferers, President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to rapidly increase France\u2019s production.\"  Source: https://archive.vn/lzMx7"

To achieve this, antigenic tests will be generalized in the short term, in addition to RT-PCRs, which remain the reference. More than 5 million tests have already been ordered and are made available to health establishments and ARS. These tests are CE marked and meet, according to the manufacturer's declarations, the minimum technical specifications provided by the High Authority for Health (sensitivity> 80%, specificity> 99%), which issued two opinions on the subject, the September 25 and October 9.https://covid-19.sante.gouv.fr/tests ).  Several screening campaigns have been initiated in universities, in particular for health students. This is for example the case in Ile-de-France with campaigns at the Faculty of Medicine of Sorbonne, Necker or even in a Nursing Training Institute in Paris. Other campaigns are being carried out in nursing homes to ensure screening of asymptomatic staff, particularly in the Occitanie, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and Ile-de-France regions. These campaigns are in progress and an assessment could be drawn up later. The ministry wanted to broaden the experiments and deployment channels across the country very quickly.  In addition, liberal health professionals (pharmacists, nurses and doctors) are now authorized to carry out these rapid antigenic tests, ensuring a large-scale deployment and closer to the population.  https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19",

These companies continue to benefit from 100% partial activity support in June, with no out-of-pocket costs for the employer, throughout the national territory. In this situation, the employee receives 70% of his previous gross remuneration (ie around 84% of the net salary) regardless of the size of the company (and 100% at the minimum wage)    - Companies whose activity has been interrupted by administrative decision due to the health crisis, or which are located in a territorial area subject to specific restrictions (...) when they experience a sharp drop in turnover, or which fall within the most affected sectors and which continue to suffer a very sharp drop in turnover, benefit from a rate of 70% until October 31, 2021    - For common law companies , the decree reduces the allocation rate for the month of June 2021 to 52%. On June 1, the remainder payable by companies in unprotected sectors increases to 25%.    - the rate of subsidy for companies of the most affected sectors by the health crisis is reduced to 60% for the month of July 2021, to 52% for August 2021 and 36% from September 1, 2021. The remaining charges for these companies will be 15% in July, then 25% in August and 40% in September. For the employees of these companies, the rate of the partial activity allowance paid to them drops to 60% of their previous gross compensation (72% net salary) from September 1, 2021.

Use of the Health Pass will not be required in schools. A four-tier system of restrictions will be in place with controls depending on the incidence of COVID-19. In summary:     Level 1 (Green): In person learning at all levels,   Level 2 (Yellow): In person learning at all levels,  Level 3 (Orange): In person learning at primary and middle schools, hybrid learning (alternating distance and in-person learning) in high schools  Level 4 (Red): In person learning in primary schools, hybrid learning for 50% of 3rd year, all 4th year and high school students.    Increasing levels of sanitary requirements, mask-wearing, restrictions on sports, and protocols for contact tracing will be applied at each level. The decision to trigger movement between levels can be taken at either national or department level.     Between 6000 and 7000 vaccination centers will be deployed in or next to schools alongside a campaign to encourage vaccination for children aged 12 and over.
