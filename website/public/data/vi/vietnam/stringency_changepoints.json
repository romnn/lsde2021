The ministry did not say when it expected to receive the vaccines, or how much they would cost. It was not clear which vaccine Vietnam intended to buy from the UK. Last month, the ministry said Vietnam would have a homegrown vaccine available by the end of 2021.    In the meantime, Vietnam will still continue developing its own COVID-19 vaccine, the Ministry of Health said. Indeed, the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) in Nha Trang City, partnering with New York City-based Icahn School of Medicine and the global health non-profit organisation PATH, expects to conduct testing on small groups of volunteers in October-December this year. The institute plans to submit documents for approval to the health ministry as early as April next year and claims to be capable of producing 30 million doses a year. By October 2021, the vaccine could be distributed to the general population, IVAC says. Once the vaccine trials on humans shows positive results, IVAC intends to erect a new factory with a capacity of between 70 million and 100 million doses per year, with an estimated budget of VND300 billion to VND500 billion (US$ 12.9 million - 21.5 million). Moreover, another Vietnamese institution, state-owned pharmaceutical firm VABIOTECH, partnering with the UK-based University of Bristol since February, said it aims to conduct trials on small groups of people at the beginning of next year. The company said it is optimising production procedures for large-scale production of the vaccine and could produce up to 100 million doses a year.

Those who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases; Confirmed COVID-19 cases during treatment;  Individuals with symptoms of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), severe viral pneumonia, or influenza-like illness (ILI); Healthcare workers attending to confirmed COVID-19 cases without applying sufficient prevention measures; New arrivals from foreign countries, individuals in centralized quarantine and one day prior to release from centralized quarantine; and individuals in isolated outbreak areas.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201008111049/https://vn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/",
        " Vietnam\u2019s contact tracing strategy stands out as uniquely comprehensive\u2014it is based on tracing degrees of contact from F0 (the infected person) through F1 (those who have had close contact with F0 or are suspected of being infected), F2 (close contact with F1), and all the way up to F5.    The process in Vietnam worked as follows:   Once a patient with COVID-19 is identified (F0), local public health officials, with support from health professionals, security officers, the military, and other civil servants, work with the patient to identify who they might have been in contact with and infected in the past 14 days.  All close contacts (F1), defined as people who have been within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of or have prolonged contact of 30 or more minutes with a confirmed COVID-19 case, are identified by this process and tested for the virus. If F1s test positive for the virus, they are placed in isolation at a hospital\u2014all COVID-19 patients are hospitalized at no cost in Vietnam, regardless of symptoms. If F1s do not test positive, they are quarantined at a government-run quarantine center for 14 days. Close contacts of the previously identified close contacts (F2s) are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201008111546/https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-vietnam",

        "Vietnam pilots seven-day quarantine for foreigners with two Covid-19 jabs    \"According to the Ministry\u2019s guidance of the month-long vaccine passport program trial in Quang Ninh Province, foreign arrivals who have received two Covid-19 jabs or recovered from the coronavirus disease will be quarantined seven days in centralized isolation facilities instead of the usual 21 days.  Noticeably, the RT-PCR test results of these foreigners must be negative for SARS-CoV-2 in their first test. They will have to take another seven days in self-isolation after finishing seven days in centralized quarantine camps.  The remaining people will be kept 14 days in centralized camps instead of 21 days like the present.  The new regulations said that foreign arrivals ought to have vaccine passports approved by their authorities and the vaccine must be accepted by either the World Health Organization, the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or Vietnam. Moreover, they have been given the final shot between 14 days and 12 months before the date of entry.  Furthermore, these arrivers must have a certificate provided by qualified bodies of the country providing treatment for them. The discharge date must be within 12 months before the date of entry.  Last but not least, the Ministry requested foreigners must fill their health declaration electronically through Bluezone or website https://tokhaiyte.vn in smartphones within 36 hours before their entry. Experts and their relatives, international students must state which approved hotels or places they would stay in for isolation.\"    link: https://archive.ph/eadpB"
