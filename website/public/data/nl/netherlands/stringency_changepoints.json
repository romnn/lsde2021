The Employee Insurance Agency will provide the company with an advance amounting to 80 per cent of the requested allowance. This will allow companies to keep paying their employees' salaries.'

Description on IMF website: \"A package of fiscal measures was announced to contain the economic impact of the outbreak. The package includes spending measures of about 10-20 billion euros (1-2 percent of GDP) in the next three months, and covering (i) compensation of up to 90 percent of labor costs for companies expecting a reduction in revenues of 20 percent or more; (ii) compensation for affected sectors (hospitality, travel, and others); (iii) support for entrepreneurs and the self-employed; (iv) scaling up of the short-time working scheme (unemployment benefit compensation available to companies needing to reduce their staff by at least 20 percent). In addition, companies can defer tax payments without penalties, and calculate provisional taxes on the basis of expected reduced activity levels. Also, public guarantee schemes, especially for SME loans, are expanded to help the most vulnerable companies to manage their liquidity problems.

In secondary schools, this applies to all pupils, regardless of their age.  * In secondary vocational education (MBO) and higher education, all students should stay 1.5 metres apart, regardless of their age;  * Since adults play a greater role in the spread of the novel coronavirus, teachers need to stay 1.5 metres apart from others whenever possible.  Some schools are requiring older students to wear masks in corridors due to lack of space. Schools are also being urged to make sure that they have proper ventilation.

The measures in this package amount to around \u20ac 11 billion in additional expenditure and \u20ac 1.5 billion in early investment.

The minimum loss of turnover to be able to claim the scheme will increase from 20% to 30% from the second period.  - Extension of the Tozo (income support self-employed) up to 30 June 2021.

The scheme will be extended three times for three months until June 30, 2021 and will be gradually phased out during that period, so that entrepreneurs have time and space to adapt.  - Additional, expanded or more accessible lending and guarantees to small and medium-sized companies for sufficient liquidity (BMKB-C, GO-C and KKC) will remain available after October 1, 2020.  - Entrepreneurs can apply for tax deferment until October 1, 2020.

        "At home you may have no more than three visitors per day, excluding children under 13.  At indoor seated venues a maximum of 30 people applies.  Indoors and outdoors a group must have no more than 4 people from different households.  There is no maximum number of people for a household.  Work from home, unless this is really not possible.  If you are aged 13 or over, wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and on public transport.  Locations with a combined function must close the section that serves food and drinks.  Retail stores must close no later than 20.00. There will be no late-night shopping.  Grocery stores may stay open later.  Coffee shops (cannabis caf\u00e9s) may only provide a takeaway service and must close by 20.00.    Events are banned, with the exception of:  food markets  trade fairs and conferences  cinemas and theatres  matches or competitions  demonstrations, gatherings and meetings as referred to in the Public Assemblies Act  Travel as little as possible.  Stay at your holiday address as much as possible.  Limited the number of outings and avoid busy places.    Limited travel restrictions and gatherings are still allowed. Therefore, it appears there are narrow protections for elderly populations.    http://web.archive.org/web/20210109133303/https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/10/13/partial-lockdown-needed-to-bring-down-infections"

It is vital that schools, childcare centres and parents do everything possible to limit the number of contacts as much as possible. Childcare staff will soon be eligible for priority testing. School staff already have priority for coronavirus testing and this will continue. A trial involving rapid testing for primary school teachers will start soon. In the very short term the education and social affairs & employment ministries will issue additional guidelines aimed at minimising the risk of infection at primary schools and childcare centres. Centres for out-of-school care (BSO) must stay closed, as this could lead to extra contacts and positive cases.    Secondary schools will remain closed until at least 1 March \u2013 after the February school holidays. They will remain open for some groups, including pupils in the upper years of secondary school sitting exams this year and vulnerable pupils. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has drafted new guidelines aimed at minimising the risk of infection, so that these schools will be able to reopen safely in the near future. To see how the guidelines work in practice for a whole school, some secondary schools will allow more pupils to come to school as of next week.

However, it is clear that some groups have a higher risk of becoming very ill or even dying.    People aged 70 and over have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus.

It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart.

The ban was initially imposed to stem the spread of a variant strain of COVID-19 originally identified in the UK; however, this strain has spread within the Netherlands to such an extent that a travel ban has no added value. Travelers from the UK are still required to present proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival.    Authorities previously extended the ban on flights with South Africa and many countries in Central and South America until at least April 1 due to concerns related to variant strains of COVID-19 in those countries. The targeted locations in the Americas currently include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Air freight transport is exempt from the travel ban.    Travel to the Netherlands is generally only permitted for European Economic Area (EEA) residents or Schengen-associated countries and residents of Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Officials prohibit most travel from other countries; however, effective March 9, the list of travel exemptions has been expanded to include healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the exercise of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.    All permitted travelers must possess proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival. All permitted travelers arriving via sea or air must also undergo a rapid COVID-19 test no more than four hours prior to boarding. Authorities will not accept results from self-administered tests. Transit passengers are also subject to this requirement. Aircrews must undergo a rapid antigen test upon disembarking. Other transport sector workers must undergo a rapid antigen test no more than 24 hours prior to departure. Additionally, all travelers must fill out a declaration form prior to entry and self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. These measures do not apply to individuals arriving from Iceland, the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand; additional exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.\"",

        "\"Coronavirus does not affect everyone in the same way. Some people have hardly any symptoms, while others become seriously ill. However, it is clear that some groups have a higher risk of becoming very ill or even dying.    People aged 70 and over have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus. This applies to healthy older people, but particularly to older people who are not fully independent. People with underlying health conditions also have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. If you have health issues, take extra care and follow the basic rules carefully.    Visits to nursing homes are allowed as long as this does not hamper efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Residents at the end of their life or in a critical condition are always allowed to have visitors. Nursing homes will assess the situation and decide when residents can receive more visitors. Guidelines have been drawn up for this purpose.   More and more residents of nursing homes and care homes for people with disabilities are being vaccinated. Because of this the rules for visits can be eased:  If the residents in a home have had both of their vaccine injections, they can receive 2 visitors per day instead of 1.  Residents can receive other visitors than the 2 or 3 people in their \u2018visitor bubble\u2019.  In the event of an outbreak in a nursing home, all residents and staff will be tested weekly.  It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart. Make clear arrangements and check before the visit whether anyone has symptoms. If a visitor or a person they want to visit has cold-like symptoms, a fever or shortness of breath, the visit should be postponed. Visits should take place outdoors, if possible, because this is safer.\"  https://web.archive.org/web/20210318104343/https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone"

        "From 15 May, Netherlands published a covid safe list where foreigners can enter the country if they were in those nations:  \"A safe country is a country where the risk of contracting COVID-19 is low. If you live in a safe country, you may travel to the Netherlands. The EU travel ban does not apply to you. It does not matter what your nationality or the purpose of your trip is. Countries that are not on the list of safe countries are considered high-risk areas.  No negative test result or self-quarantine required  If you are coming from a country where the risk of contracting COVID-19 is low (a safe country) you do not need to show a negative test result when you travel to the Netherlands. You are also not required to self-quarantine when you arrive in the Netherlands.

        "\"Authorities in the Netherlands are designating the UK, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal as very high risk as of June 15 due to concerns over the spread of a COVID-19 virus variant strain in those countries. All travelers that arrive from very high-risk locations need to present either a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding transport or a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in the Netherlands coupled with a negative rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding. These travelers will also need to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. Vaccinated passengers are also subject to this requirement. Exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as cross-border workers, health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.    Entry is generally only permitted for residents of EEA or Schengen-associated countries, as well as those of the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Japan, Rwanda, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Officials prohibit most travel from other countries. Exemptions are in place for healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the performance of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.    Individuals arriving from designated low-risk destinations may enter the Netherlands without restrictions.
