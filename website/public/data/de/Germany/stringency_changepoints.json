A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible. The Federal Government will discuss this with the business community later this week.   -\\tAll asymptomatic citizens will be allowed a free rapid test at least once a week, including a certificate of the test result, at a testing centre operated by the respective Land or municipality, at third parties commissioned by the respective Land or municipality or at GPs\u2019 surgeries.
