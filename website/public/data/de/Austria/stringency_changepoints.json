The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19\",\"No policy change     As of 19 December, detailed, multilingual information is still available on the Social Ministry's website (https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus).

Contact persons are defined as persons with defined contact to a confirmed case during the time period of infectivity (48 hours before the onset of the disease, up to 10 days after the onset of the disease).    Contact tracers notify persons which shared the same environment as the confirmed case. Depending on how long and intensive the contact was with this person, one is identified as contact person K1 or K2. Further instructions are then given depending upon this classification.    \u201cStop Corona\u201d app is Austria\u2019s official contact tracing app which automatically records any and all contacts while adhering to strict data protection guidelines.

When meeting in closed public spaces, a distance of one meter must be kept and mouth and nose protection must be worn.    It is not compulsory to wear mouth and nose protection outdoors, with the exception of the events listed in Section 12 of the ordinance (e.g. demonstrations, funerals). Regarding this, there may be regional rules of their own.    In the workplace, mouth and nose protection must be worn in closed rooms if physical contact with other people cannot be ruled out and the risk of infection cannot be minimized by other suitable protective measures (e.g. by means of a technical protective device such as partition or plexiglass walls).     If technical protective measures make it impossible to carry out the work (e.g. for actors), organizational protective measures (such as the formation of permanent teams) must be provided instead.    Employees and employers can mutually agree on stricter regulations regarding the wearing of mouth and nose protection.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201219044559/https://corona-ampel.gv.at/aktuelle-massnahmen/bundesweite-massnahmen/\",\"As of 19 December, there is no COVID-19 vaccine available in Austria.    There will be free vaccines for all people in Austria who want to be vaccinated. The republic will buy the vaccines centrally and distribute them to many places, which will then carry out the vaccinations.    The federal government and other government representatives have repeatedly emphasized that there will be no general compulsory vaccination.    The first effective, safe and effective vaccines in relevant quantities could be available in Austria from the beginning of 2021. The crucial point is the central European approval for the European Union. Only then will the vaccines meet the statutory quality requirements.

The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to 20 June inclusive.    Other COVID-19 entry regulations  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021.      The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    A current 3-G certificate is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be performed immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.    The following countries are currently on Annex A:  Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Principality of Liechtenstein, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprus.    2. Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine  Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before. In essence, only Austrian citizens and persons with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine upon entry, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.    Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days.

COVID-19 Entry Regulation  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021 . The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 3G proof is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.    The following states are currently on Annex A:  Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Principality of Liechtenstein, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprus.    2. Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine    Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before.     Essentially, only Austrian citizens and people with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine when entering the country, but tested people do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.  Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days. The compulsory registration does not apply when entering from a country listed in Appendix A if a 3G proof can be presented upon entry.

On the basis of this classification, the Education Directorate determines the risk level for the federal state in agreement with the central office by ordinance. The responsible education directorate then informs the schools. Defined framework conditions also enable flexible measures to be taken at the school location. Further information can be found on the website of the  Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF).\\\"    *Universities*  Does the \u201c3-G rule\u201d - tested, recovered, vaccinated - also apply to universities and colleges?Inhalt zuklappen  In any case, it is recommended that the so-called \\\"3-G rule\\\" also authorize access to universities and colleges. As in other areas of life, those who have been tested, recovered and vaccinated should be granted access to the campus. For this, the current legal basis, the 2nd COVID-19 University Act , has been extended to the upcoming winter semester 2021/22 until February 28, 2022 and adjusted accordingly. The 3G rule is particularly relevant for participation in face-to-face courses, face-to-face exams or participation in selection, aptitude and admission procedures on site . The proven approach remains that the University and college managements are responsible for determining the specific corona measures at their locations. They know the respective conditions and requirements on site best. However, they have to guarantee the applicable level of protection, for which the current, general corona protection and hygiene measures offer a valuable basis.     Therefore, please inform yourself directly at your respective university or college how they organize their teaching and examination operations and which Corona measures they intend to take.    The 3-G rule states:     The 2nd COVID-19 Opening Ordinance defines precise criteria as to when one belongs to the group of people who have a \\\"low epidemiological risk\\\".   - Anyone who has been vaccinated with a centrally approved COVID-19 vaccine is considered vaccinated. The first vaccination counts from the 22nd day after the 1st prick for a maximum of three months from the time of vaccination. After the 2nd bite you are immunized for a total of 20 days. Vaccines for which only one vaccination is intended (e.g. from Johnson & Johnson) are valid from the 22nd day after the vaccination for a total of 270 days. This also applies to people who can be proven to have recovered as soon as they have received the first stitch.   - As tested applies to those who can provide evidence of a negative PCR test or a negative antigen test. PCR tests are valid for 72 hours from the time the sample is taken, and antigen tests for 48 hours if performed by an authorized body. Self-tests that are recorded in an official data processing system in the federal states are valid for 24 hours. In addition, there are exceptionally supervised point-of-sale tests for one-time entry of sports facilities, business premises, restaurants, hotels or an event.  - As recovered applies to those who can present a separation notice of a SARS-COV-2 infection or a medical confirmation within the last six months. Alternatively, a corresponding antibody test can be presented, which, however, must not be older than three months.  You can find more detailed information about the 3-G rule and the other applicable protective and hygiene measures on the website of the Federal Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) .
