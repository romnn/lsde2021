        " Health Ministry, Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser differ on mask use. The Ministry\u2019s standing recommendation is that not everybody should be wearing masks. Among those who are not healthcare workers, only those who had a cough or exhibited signs of a flu or a respiratory illness need to be wearing them as did those caring for COVID-19 patients. The reason this isn\u2019t recommended for the public at large \u2014 though now almost anyone on the street can be seen to be wearing them \u2014 is that it will lead to a shortage and unavailability for doctors, nurses and other hospital staff.  On Tuesday, however, the office of the PSA through the Press Information Bureau recommended the widespread use of masks. It endorsed, above all, home-made masks that could easily be made and were reusable with washing and sanitising.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200520015039/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indias-health-ministry-office-of-the-principal-scientific-adviser-differ-on-mask-use/article31216536.ece"

The pricing and procurement routes of Sputnik V in India is interesting. It is the first COVID19 vaccine that seems to be procured and may potentially be sold outside of Govt channels in India -- at least with its pilot program that started the rollout of this particular vaccine.   2. Next, given that the vaccine's deployment is still in very early stages it is unclear to what extent it would be available to private hospitals and organizations (i.e. outside of govt. channels).  3. It is also not clear the extent to which Sputnik shots would be covered/funded by Central/State/Local governments.   4. Given its early days, for now, I am going to continue marking H7 as \"govt. funded\" ... as its deployment increases, and levels of Govt funding for Sputnik V becomes clearer, H7 may need to be coded as 4I.    https://archive.vn/62Q0H: Date 14 May 2021 Sputnik V was rolled out in India in a limited pilot program by Dr. Reddy's Lab in Hyderabad on May 14 2021:: \"India on Friday began using Sputnik V in its battle against COVID-19 with the first dose of the vaccine from Russia administered in Hyderabad. The vaccine is being sold at a maximum retail price of ?995 per dose.  The use of the vaccine follows clearance for the imported doses from the Central Drugs Laboratory in Kasauli on Thursday. Sputnik V that last month was accorded emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India... .  Members of the senior leadership of Dr. Reddy\u2019s said the vaccine will be supplied at the same price \u2014?948 plus 5% GST \u2014 to both government and private sector. For the consumers, there would also be administering charges levied by hospitals. Given that the vaccine must be stored at minus 18 degrees C and the lack of availability of such cold chain infrastructure, the company said, \u201cWe will begin with Metros and Tier 1 cities and scale up to the rest of India.\u201d   In the run up to the launch, the company\u2019s leadership had said the cost of imported Sputnik V, which is a two dose vaccine, in India would hover around the $10 a dose at which it was priced in other global markets by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).  Co-Chairman and Managing Director G.V. Prasad said, \u201cWe are prioritising our efforts to launch Sputnik V vaccine across India.\u201d Dr. Reddy\u2019s was also in discussion with a couple of State governments for vaccine offtake.\"    ---------------    \"On 19 April, it was announced that the next phase of the vaccine program would begin on 1 May, extending eligibility to all residents over the age of 18.
