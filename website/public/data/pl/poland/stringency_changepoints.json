There are general hygiene practices in schools: washing your hands frequently (as soon as you come to school), protecting yourself when sneezing and coughing, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. People entering the school building should be able to use a hand sanitizer. If it is possible, in the cloakroom, every second box should be made available for students or different hours of coming to school should be introduced.    As far as possible, work should be organized in such a way as to keep distance between people in school and to limit the concentration of students.
