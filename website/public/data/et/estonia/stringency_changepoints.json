        "The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund will be paying subsidies to compensate employees\u2019 wages for up to two months during period March- May 2020. The amount of the subsidy will be 70% of the average monthly wage of the employee but no more than \u20ac1000. The employer must pay a wage of at least \u20ac150 to the employee.    The employer comply with at least two of the following terms:    The employer must have suffered at least a 30% decline in turnover or revenue for the month they wish to be subsidized for, as compared to the same month last year.  The employer is not able to provide at least 30 percent of their employees with agreed workload.  The employer has cut the wages of at least 30% of employees by at least 30% or down to the minimum wage.    The board of the Unemployment Insurance Fund agreed on March 18; individuals will be compensated retroactively for the period between March 1st and May 31st.   Given that the median wage in Estonia is 1221\u20ac (2019), more than half of workers in Estonia will be below this maximum at 70%, hence upgraded to 2 on review.   http://web.archive.org/web/20200604220449/https://www.kriis.ee/en/economy-and-business  https://web.archive.org/web/20200502110238/https://news.err.ee/1063398/banks-prepared-to-give-grace-period-to-borrowers-facing-coronavirus-effects"

        "Estonia's coronavirus exposure notification app \"HOIA\" launches today (August 20) and is now available to download. The purpose of the free app - which is optional and not mandatory - is to inform close contacts of those infected with the coronavirus and to provide them with initial instructions on how to proceed. Its aim is to limit the spread of coronavirus. In this way, the user can quickly find out about possible close contact with a COVID-19 infected person, allowing them to take steps to protect their own health and the health of others.    Since this amounts to at least a limited effort of contact tracing, upgraded to 1 on review.     https://web.archive.org/web/20200924200214/https://news.err.ee/1125119/feature-estonia-launches-coronavirus-exposure-notification-app-hoia  https://web.archive.org/web/20200927101653/https://e-estonia.com/trace-covid-19-while-respecting-privacy/"

From Monday, 19 October - in situations where the infection rate of countries is higher than 1.1x the Estonian average, or above 50, a person is allowed to come to Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania or Finland without the self-isolation obligation, if the person has taken a coronavirus test within 48 hours before arriving to Estonia, and the result of the test has been negative. At that, it must be taken into account that the person must not have travelled outside the Baltic states or Finland in the past two weeks.    At the border crossing points, i.e. ports, airports and checkpoints at Russian land borders, the travel documents and medical symptoms are checked. Border control personnel have legal rights to deny entering for persons who show symptoms of COVID-19, i.e. to deport them back to the country of arrival. A person entering Estonia from a country to which the quarantine requirements apply will have to provide the Police and Border Guard Board their address and confirm that they will remain at their place of stay for 14 days.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201023010834/https://vm.ee/en/information-countries-and-quarantine-requirements-passengers    https://web.archive.org/web/20201023004230/https://www.visitestonia.com/en/why-estonia/coronavirus-and-travelling-to-estonia  "
