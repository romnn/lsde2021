        "AW Update from Lucy Goodfellow original: \u201cHere are the four measures announced on Thursday: The release of the so-called 'countercyclical capital buffer' banks have been required to keep on their books since the 2007 financial crisis. This will provide them an extra 200bn Danish kroner in liquidity, which they can either use to lend to businesses or to withstand losses on existing loans. Two new loan guarantee schemes, one for large companies and one for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The government will guarantee 70 percent of the value of any new bank loans given to SMEs who have seen operating profits fall by more than 50 percent. This could back up to 4.8bn kroner in new loans. It will guarantee 70 percent of the value of new loans to large companies who can demonstrate a fall in turnover over more than 50 percent. This could back 2.7bn kroner in new loans. Employers from now on be completely reimbursed by the government from the first day that an employee becomes ill or enters quarantine due to coronavirus, rather than having to themselves absorb the bill for the few days. Employment legislation is being relaxed to allow companies to reduce employees hours temporarily, with the employees incomes then supplemented by unemployment benefit. The Ministry of Employment hopes that this will prevent employees from being laid off.\u201d (source: https://www.thelocal.dk/20200313/denmark-moves-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-impact) 4.8bn kr + 2.7bn kr = 7.5bn kr, which is $1,112,519,985.92 on 13.03.20 http://web.archive.org/web/20200415142429/https://www.x-rates.com/historical/?from=USD&amount=1&date=2020-03-13"

These recommended that family members and  friends should not visit nursing homes (or hospitals) unless strictly necessary, for instance if the  person was terminally ill. The individual institution should ensure that the visit could be  conducted in a safe manner, for instance by ensuring that it was only a brief visit, that visitors  did not sit in common areas and that they did not have physical contact or use common  facilities. The institution was required to inform visitors about the risk of spreading the disease  and encouraging them to avoid visiting, through posters (see poster below with the message  \u2018You best protect your loved ones by not visiting them\u2019) and personal instruction. If family  members had symptoms, they were not allowed to visit.

The guidelines  also outlined who and how many could receive the test and who was in charge. Also, it now  recommended that staff wore PPE, regardless of whether the user had symptoms or not.     On May 12th an extensive publication providing new guidelines on how to organize visits in  nursing homes was published by the Board of Health. From the introduction, it was made clear that the Board of Health did not have the authority over who could visit, as this was the  responsibility of the Board for Patient Safety, and thus underlining the general confusion over  which authority was in charge.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200715194521/https://ltccovid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-COVID-19-Long-Term-Care-situation-in-Denmark-29-May-2020-1.pdf    https://web.archive.org/web/20210111193839/https://www.sst.dk/-/media/Udgivelser/2020/Corona/Status-og-strategi/COVID19-8-epidemiuge.ashx?la=da&hash=1EE6DCA211CAF1E9D7FA085FADA69F17C505436B"

The current timetables for busses, the light rail, trains and the metro have therefore been downscaled.

        "As of September 1 2020: Employers in Denmark can apply to send staff home for 20-50 percent of their normal working hours, with wages compensated by the government, under a new scheme to help firms affected by the coronavirus crisis. By \u2018workload sharing\u2019, the scheme enables companies to share available work between employees when there is less to do than under normal circumstances. That allows, say, two employees to be retained even though operations are only at 50 percent of capacity, because both employees can be sent home 50 percent of the time and receive full pay, with the government scheme covering costs. The new scheme replaces a former wage compensation scheme which expired at the end of August. The scheme is additional to other schemes in place to support individuals and companies during the covid-19 period.    http://web.archive.org/web/20200914191430/https://www.thelocal.dk/20200901/part-time-pay-for-corona-hit-companies-heres-how-denmarks-new-wage-scheme-works"

Further, particular efforts will be targeted at young citizens in Greater  Copenhagen who typically account for the highest infection rates.

In addition, Denmark\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged all its citizens to avoid travelling to other countries due to the disease\u2019s rapid spread, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

Starting April 21, the Danish government will begin using a color-coded system for classifying foreign countries as being at one of three risk levels - red, orange, or yellow - based on local infection rates and the presence of variant strains, and will apply international travel restrictions accordingly. Travelers arriving from \"yellow\" countries or regions will not need to self-isolate upon entry. Those arriving from ''orange'' and \"red\" areas will need to self-isolate for 10 days upon entry. In addition, business travelers will no longer be required to quarantine. All travelers must still, upon arrival, present a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to travel.  Starting May 1, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of Denmark, as well as tourists from yellow and orange countries, will be able to travel to Denmark without restrictions. In addition, the requirement for a negative Covid-19 test result will change; effective May 1, the test will need to have been taken no more than 48 hours before travel, rather than the current threshold of 24 hours.  Most travel from outside the EEA, with the exception of that from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, will be prohibited. Exemptions are in place for EU nationals or residents and their family members, individuals carrying out essential work, or individuals traveling for urgent reasons.  https://archive.vn/Byc3A",
