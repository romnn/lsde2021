This assistance takes the form of a single lump sum capital grant of up to \u20ac500 per employee, whose monthly remuneration is greater than or equal to the minimum social wage and less than or equal to the qualified minimum social wage (SSM). Compensation assistance takes into account employees who were hired before 31 December 2020 and who will have been in employment during a monthly period between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021. This assistance is intended for sectors most affected by the health crisis, namely tourism, events, culture, hospitality, entertainment, retail trade as well as managers of continuous vocational training organisations.

        "Coded as 3 because testing is available to much of the asymptomatic population, but asymptomatic people only have access to a free PCR test if they receive an invitation from the government. Private laboratories also offer testing, but this is not free.     The Luxembourg government is embarking on a new phase of screening with the aim to test representative samples of the population in order to monitor developments and to be as flexible as possible in the event of an increase in the number of cases. This is the best way to break infection chains and effectively trace the contacts of infected people.    The COVID-19 test at the invitation of the Luxembourg Government concerns residents and cross-border workers. It is free of charge.    The Large Scale Testing strategy divides people into representative groups, e.g. according to business sector, age and place of residence. This means that members of the same household, residents of a residential area or a circle of colleagues receive invitations deliberately staggered by several weeks according to the targeted samples. This also makes it possible to maintain continuous testing. It is therefore a strategy based on a large scale sampling approach. This organised exercise makes it possible to control and keep the rate of infections at a very low level and thus ensure the protection of everyone. The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and protects us all.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213106/https://covid19.public.lu/en/testing.html",

Any person who has tested positive for COVID-19 is contacted as soon as possible by the Health Inspection; and  is assigned a reference number. While waiting for a call from the Contact Tracing Unit, the person who has tested positive can help trace and identify people with whom they have had high-risk contact.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213748/https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/sante-social/coronavirus/tracage-contact/participation-tracage-contacts.html",
