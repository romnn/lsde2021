This new app, which can be downloaded on Android and IOS devices is free of cost, and will be an official digital platform for COVID-19 tests in the UAE.  The app allows individuals to benefit from services developed in the country, including receiving COVID-19 test results on their phones. Every user will have a unique QR code, which will serve as a guide on his health status.  The ALHOSN UAE app depends on the use of short-term Bluetooth signals, to show whether the person is in close proximity to people who have had contact with patients infected with the Covid-19 virus. This is possible if they also have the same app on their phones as the phones exchange the metadata stored in them. The app is also encrypted and the data remain only on the user's phone. Through this data, the competent health authorities can quickly identify people at risk of transmission to them so that they can communicate with them and retest them again.  ALHOSN UAE application also provides a service that shows the extent to which people in home quarantine adhere to the instructions and avoid contact with other people. This is all aimed at protecting the people in quarantine as well as the rest of the society."

While maintaining all previous preventive measures in shopping malls and retail outlets, the updates allow the refund and return of goods and use of fitting rooms with the condition that strict precautionary conditions aimed at ensuring the safety of customers be observed.  The updates also allow the opening of public parks with strict enforcement of specific preventive measures. These include ensuring gatherings do not exceed five people. Hotels are allowed to reopen their private beaches only to their guests while enforcing stringent preventive measures, the most important of which is mandatory physical distancing between individuals.  In addition, sports and recreational activities will be permitted in open spaces for up to five people, including cycling, water sports and skydiving. Comprehensive preventive measures have to be maintained while engaging in these sporting activities."

The app allows individuals to benefit from services developed in the country, including receiving COVID-19 test results on their phones. Every user will have a unique QR code, which will serve as a guide on his health status.    The ALHOSN UAE app depends on the use of short-term Bluetooth signals, to show whether the person is in close proximity to people who have had contact with patients infected with the Covid-19 virus. This is possible if they also have the same app on their phones as the phones exchange the metadata stored in them. The app is also encrypted and the data remain only on the user's phone. Through this data, the competent health authorities can quickly identify people at risk of transmission to them so that they can communicate with them and retest them again.

Currently, tourist visas are being issued in Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports. Visitors can travel to Abu Dhabi by road but must present a negative PCR test or negative laser blood test with results received within 48 hours before departure. Abu Dhabi residents or visitors from outside the Abu Dhabi Emirates who enter Abu Dhabi and stay for more than four consecutive days or more are required to take an additional PCR test on the fourth day. Those staying in Abu Dhabi for more than eight consecutive days must take an additional PCR test on the eighth day. Other measures in effect in the UAE are included below: If departing from Abu Dhabi to the EU or UK, you will need to have a negative PCR test result taken within 96 hours prior to your departure. Stringent precautionary measures will continue to be enforced in public areas and facilities across the UAE based on guidelines issued by local and federal authorities. Arrivals in Abu Dhabi from countries that authorities consider high risk are likely to be required to quarantine for at least 14 days. These include but are not limited to Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Chile. Additional high-risk countries can be found on the UAE Government website.

        "ABU DHABI, 20th March, 2021 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Health and Prevention has urged all Emiratis and residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccination to start booking appointments for inoculation starting Sunday, March 21, now that the six-week priority entitlement given to people who are most at risk of infection is over.    Those eligible for vaccination, including citizens and residents aged 16 and above, can now get inoculated for free in any of the 205 vaccination locations available nationwide, the ministry said in a statement tonight.    The statement said it's incumbent on those opting for vaccination to get prior booking as those who are most vulnerable to infection will continue to be received by vaccination centres without prior booking.    The past six weeks saw a collaborative effort made by all health departments to prioritise those most at risk of infection, including the elderly and people with chronic diseases, such as heart, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses.    In the meantime, Dr. Abdul Rahman bin Mohammad bin Nasser Al Owais, Minister of Health and Prevention, said Saturday that 72.89 percent of elderly Emiratis and residents and those with chronic diseases have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and that 56.59 percent of the eligible population have been inoculated against the disease.    In line with the Ministry's plans as well as the objectives of the National COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, to ensure acquired community immunity, the Ministry has urged all the eligible population to get vaccinated and to encourage their family members, friends and colleagues to follow suit for their common good.    The UAE has approved four Covid vaccines for emergency uses: Sinopharm; Pfizer-BioNTech; Sputnik V; and Oxford-AstraZeneca. In addition, MoHAP is constantly working to get the entire UAE population vaccinated as soon as possible.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210322152304/http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302920029"
