Avoid contact with individuals who have COVID-19 symptoms.   Wash your hands with soap and water frequently, and use a hand sanitizer after sneezing or coughing, as well as before cooking or eating food.   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.   Avoid close contact with people who show symptoms.    Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow. Make sure to wash your hands with soap and water for 40 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer instead.   If you have a chronic disease, make sure you take the prescribed medications as scheduled.   Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects at home, either using regular household cleaners, or diluted bleach. Use 250 ml (1 cup) of water  for every 5ml (1 teaspoon) of bleach. Never mix bleach with other chemical products and use it only in well-ventilated areas.   Use mobile applications to order food and medicine.   Use smartphone applications to get your medicine.   Avoid going to mosques.  \"    http://web.archive.org/web/20201018062538/https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/EducationalContent/Health-of-Older-Persons/Pages/008.aspx"

For more coronavirus news, visit our dedicated page.  Over 587 vaccination centers have opened across the Kingdom to ensure all citizens and residents have easy access to the dose, according to the ministry.    Last month, the Kingdom announced it would be expanding its national coronavirus vaccine campaign to include a much larger segment of its population.  The registered priority groups have all received their COVID-19 vaccines, which is why the ministry has now made the dose available to other groups of people.  Individuals who wish to be vaccinated must first register on the official Sehhaty application.  They can then book direct appointments according to the available dates and the nearest vaccination center, according to the health ministry.  \u201cThis step comes as a continuation of health efforts to preserve the safety of citizens and residents and limit the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate vaccination,\u201d the health ministry had said at the time.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210418035700/https://english.alarabiya.net/coronavirus/2021/04/18/More-than-7-mln-people-in-Saudi-Arabia-received-COVID-19-vaccine-Ministry-"

About Tawakkalna: As the Saudi Arabian Government is keen to preserve the health and safety of citizens and residents within its soil from the risk of the spread of novel coronavirus; The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) developed Tawakkalna App in order to support government efforts aimed at countering Covid-19.   Tawakkalna App was developed to facilitate the issuance of movement permits electronically during the curfew period for government and private sector employees, as well as individuals, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and all relevant authorities during the curfew, thus helping to reduce the spread of the pandemic in the Kingdom.  Tawakkalna helps individuals, security, health and private entities, that are exempted from the curfew, to automatize all transactions between relevant parties in order to mitigate the health, economic and social impacts that may result from the implementation of policies taken to eliminate the spread of Covid-19.  Now, as we cautiously return to normal life, Tawakkalna is helping in this phase by new services such as showing Users\u2019 health condition and other services.  And as a part of promoting social responsibility, Tawakkalna has provided many services regarding raising concern if there are violations, as well as providing the ability to notify Ministry of Health in the event of a suspected case.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210822175904/https://ta.sdaia.gov.sa/en/index  https://web.archive.org/web/20210329224450/https://sa.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/",
