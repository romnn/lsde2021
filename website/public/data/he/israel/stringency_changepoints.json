Taking a first PCR coronavirus test as soon as possible after going into isolation.  Taking a second PCR coronavirus test 10 days after the date of the last contact with confirmed patient or entry to Israel, and at least 24 hours after the first test.  Should both tests return negative, the person in isolation will receive approval (either by text message or by phone call), and he or she may go out of isolation 12 days after the last date of contact with the confirmed patient or returning from abroad.  Tests should be taken in the \"test-and-drive\" (drive in) sites or in task-specific sites for people in isolation.  Suppose the person in isolation develops any symptoms at any time during the isolation period. In that case, the isolation period cannot be reduced, and this person will be required to test again.    This protocol will also be retroactively applied to anyone currently in isolation.\"    https://web.archive.org/web/20201123122848/https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/12112020-02"

        "Restrictions to transport routes, movement, suggestion that schools may have closed where violence is escalating in Israel with exchanges of fire between Israel and Gaza.  These restrictions aren't Covid-19 related so the coding remains as advised in the Local Councils Traffic Light Model.    Annual leave restrictions and reclaiming holiday - posted on Facebook by The Commissioner for Foreign Workers' Labor Rights    What happens if an employee is unable to take annual leave because of COVID-19 restrictions? Can vacation days be accrued?  Many employees and employers turn to us for assistance regarding the redemption of vacation days. Here are 8 things you need to know about redemption of vacation days:  1. An annual vacation is a basic right. Under applicable laws, the employee advised to use his available vacation days to refresh himself and regain strength. Caregiving is a challenging profession, so taking a vacation is essential.    2. Since vacation days cannot always be taken during the year for various reasons (especially in these days of COVID-19 restrictions), the law permits employees to use part of the vacation days but at least 7 days a year, and add the unused days to the next two employment years.    3. It is important to note that accruing vacation days is prohibited by the annual leave law. Employees who accumulate vacation days in violation of the law may lose the right to use those days either in realization or in monetary redemption.    4. A worker who has illegally accumulated vacation days (beyond what he is permitted to accumulate) or didn't use them for a vacation during the two years after the year in which they were given- can lose the right to vacation days.    5. To have accrued vacation days taken away from an employee's and for an employer to be permitted to \"delete\" them, an employer must prove that he has given the employee the opportunity to go on vacation and that the employee has not done so.    6. If the employee's employment was terminated, whether he resigned or his employment was terminated, the money from the vacation days left to his credit should be taken. Meaning it is not an annual bonus as is commonly mistaken.    7. We must emphasize the fact that early redemption of annual leave before the end of the employment period is illegal and in direct violation of the law and purpose of annual leave. An employer who chooses to do so risks double payment.    8. The employer has an obligation to give the employee his vacation days. In case the employer prevents an employee from going on vacation, he does not erase vacation days accrued on the employee's credit.    Source: https://archive.vn/Erdny  "

        "Interesting to note the debate in the Knesset about the areas in the tourism/aviation/transport industries which in practical terms rely wholly on incoming tourism, which is still restricted at this point.    \"MK Barak, who initiated the meeting, said at the start of the discussion that during the extension of the [paid] furlough periods, the question arose repeatedly what would happen with the industries that would remain closed at the end of the furlough period. She said that the Finance Minister had replied that when the time came, a response would be given to industries that were still in a difficult situation, and now the time has come: \u201cWe thought that we would have a functional government, and we're not there, but this population needs clear solutions to several industries. Present here are the aviation industry, the travel agents, the hotel managers, the business sector, tour operators; this refers both to larger companies and to small businesses that need to know what is happening with them. We are committed to continuing the [paid] furlough for all those whose businesses remain in existence but are unable to operate; in addition, some of the workers will have to be dismissed, and preparations have to be made for a month's advance notice. We are demanding a clear plan from the Ministry of Finance on the issue of the furlough, so that we can make clear decisions by the end of May. This is an industry that generates a great deal of money for the state, and supports many families here, and we have to make sure that it continues to breathe.\"    Source: https://archive.vn/mvE5B",

These are hotels that rely mostly on incoming tourism. In the ten days of warfare, the domestic [tourism] hotels lost about NIS 100 million, in Eilat the cancellation rate stood at 30-40 percent. This sequence of events is intolerable for us.     \u201cThis situation requires further assistance even after June, when all the circles of broad-based aid end\u2014continued property tax breaks, permanent grants and of course, flexible furloughs for workers.\"    Source: https://archive.vn/mvE5B#selection-1285.0-1289.199"
