Match day income for top sports will also be compensated, in addition to the loss of ticket income.    Organizations that have a significant loss of income from events or other specified activity that is partially canceled, closed or postponed as a result of orders or advice from state authorities, can apply for 70 percent compensation throughout the year.    For events or other specified activities that are completely canceled, the compensation is reduced to 50 percent from 1 November to 31 December. For those who complete, the net loss of income will be compensated with 70 percent also after 1 November. With this, the government wants to stimulate activity.

All travelers, including Norwegian citizens and residents, need to provide a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to arrival; persons arriving by plane may take the test no more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time for the first part of the flight. Upon arrival, travelers must take a rapid coronavirus test at the airport or border and wait at the test station until the result is known.    Authorities require all arrivals, including Norwegian nationals and permanent residents, returning from nonessential travel abroad to quarantine at designated hotels for 10 days. The quarantine period may be shortened if a negative COVID-19 test result is received no earlier than seven days after entry into the country. There are a limited number of exceptions where arrivals will not be required to quarantine. In addition, business travelers who are able to document that their employer is able to provide a suitable alternative accommodation may be exempt from the hotel quarantine.    All permitted travelers from high-risk areas must register with authorities within 72 hours before arrival. As of April 15 only Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Finnish hospital districts of Central Ostrobothnia, North Ostrobothnia, South Ostrobothnia, Kainuu, Lappi, Lansi-Pohja, are not considered high-risk areas.

        "\"International Entry RestrictionsUnder existing directives, only Norwegian citizens and legal residents are allowed to enter the country; however, exemptions are in place for close family members of Norwegian residents, transport workers, individuals in transit, and foreigners who work in critical fields. All travelers, including Norwegian citizens and residents, need to provide a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to arrival; persons arriving by plane may take the test no more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time for the first leg of the flight. Upon arrival, travelers must take a rapid coronavirus test at the airport or border and wait at the test station until the result is known.    Authorities require all persons returning from nonessential travel abroad, including Norwegian nationals and permanent residents, as well as all travelers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Iraq, including those returning from essential trips, to quarantine at designated hotels for 10 days. The quarantine period may be shortened if a negative COVID-19 test result is received no earlier than seven days after entry into the country. There are a limited number of exceptions under which arrivals are not required to quarantine. In addition, business travelers who are able to document that their employer can provide suitable alternative accommodations may be exempt from the hotel quarantine.    All permitted travelers from high-risk areas must register with authorities within 72 hours before arrival. As of May 5, only Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Finnish hospital districts of Central Ostrobothnia, Lappi, North Karelia, and Ita-Savo are not considered high-risk areas.

        "\"Authorities in Norway plan to ease certain COVID-19-related international entry restrictions. Starting May 27, authorities will allow foreign travelers who reside in designated quarantine-exempt (\"yellow\") countries or areas to enter without restrictions. As of May 25, Greenland, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, and the Finnish hospital districts of Central Ostrobothnia, Lappi, North Karelia, and Ita-Savo, are the only locations on Norway's quarantine-exempt list. Authorities expect more countries to be added to the list as vaccination rates in the European Economic Area (EEA) increase.    In addition, starting May 27, authorities will remove the requirement for permitted travelers arriving from non-essential trips in certain EEA and Schengen countries, as well as the UK, to isolate in government-designated hotels. Travelers from European countries where fewer than 150 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants have been reported in the previous 14 days will not be required to isolate in designated hotels. Those arriving from countries outside of the EEA, Schengen Zone, or the UK must still isolate at designated hotels for 10 days. The quarantine period may be shortened if a negative COVID-19 test result is received no earlier than seven days after entry into the country.    Generally, only Norwegian citizens and legal residents are allowed to enter the country; however, exemptions are in place for close family members of Norwegian residents, transport workers, individuals in transit, and foreigners who work in critical fields. All travelers, including Norwegian citizens and residents, need to provide a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to arrival; persons arriving by plane may take the test no more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time for the first leg of the flight. Upon arrival, travelers must take a rapid coronavirus test at the airport or border and wait at the test station until the result is known.    All permitted travelers from high-risk areas must register with authorities within 72 hours before arrival. Cross-border commuters from Sweden and Finland are permitted to enter Norway without the need to isolate provided they take a COVID-19 test every seven days.\"    https://web.archive.org/web/20210527223725/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/483106/norway-authorities-to-ease-certain-covid-19-international-entry-restrictions-from-may-27-update-43",

Starting June 19, additional categories of foreigners residing in the European Economic Area (EEA) area or the United Kingdom who are related to Norwegian citizens may seek approval for entry. Travelers who have spent the last ten days in locations within the EEA and Schengen Zone with less than 500 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous two weeks will undergo self-isolation for ten days upon entry instead of hotel quarantine. However, quarantine rules for entrants who have stayed outside the EEA and Schengen Zone for the last ten days before arrival continue; they must stay in quarantine hotels until they obtain a negative PCR test taken no earlier than three days after entry. The measure will also affect UK travelers from June 21. Additional relaxations are planned from July 5, in line with regionwide EEA measures.    Foreign travelers who reside in designated quarantine-exempt (\"yellow\") countries or areas may enter without restrictions. As of June 19, Greenland, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, and the Finnish hospital districts of Central Finland, North Ostrobothnia, South Ostrobothnia, Lappi, Kainuu, North Karelia, Satakunta, South-Karelia, Pohjos-Savo, Vaasa, and Ita-Savo, are the only locations on Norway's quarantine-exempt list. Additions from 00:00 June 21 include Poland, Romania, as well as the Finnish hospital districts of Central Ostrobothnia, Etel\u00e4-Savo, Kanta-H\u00e4me, Kymenlaakso, Pirkanmaa, and Varsinais-Suomi. Authorities expect more countries to be added to the list as vaccination rates in the EEA increase.    Persons who have been fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 in the last six months will not need to quarantine upon entry. This will only apply to travelers who can prove this by showing a secure and verifiable QR code solution; travelers can check whether their information may be verified by clicking here.    Generally, only Norwegian citizens and legal residents are allowed to enter the country; however, exemptions are in place for close family members of Norwegian residents, transport workers, individuals in transit, and foreigners who work in critical fields. All travelers, including Norwegian citizens and residents, need to provide a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours before arrival; persons arriving by plane may take the test no more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time for the first leg of the flight. Upon arrival, travelers must take a rapid coronavirus test at the airport or border and wait at the test station until the result is known.    All permitted travelers from high-risk areas must register at the Entry Norway website, available by clicking here, within 72 hours before arrival. In addition, cross-border commuters from Sweden and Finland are permitted to enter Norway without isolating, provided they take a COVID-19 test every seven days.\"    https://web.archive.org/web/20210624145028/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/492546/norway-authorities-plan-relaxations-of-covid-19-international-entry-and-domestic-restrictions-as-of-june-19-update-45",

Up to 1000 people are allowed at indoor events with assigned seating, while up to 100 people can attend outdoor events with assigned seating. Sports events and on-site work in offices may resume with social distancing measures. Nonessential businesses and services may operate, albeit subject to strict social distancing and hygiene measures. Individuals are advised to limit their social contact and avoid all nonessential travel. Protective facemasks are recommended rather than mandatory. Municipalities with higher rates of infection may impose stricter measures within their jurisdictions.    In Oslo, events with fixed seatings are restricted to 200 people indoors and 600 people outdoors. Private gatherings and leisure group activities may involve up to 30 people depending on the venue.

Orange and Red Countries: Must present a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test taken within 24 hours before arrival or 24 hours before boarding aircraft, submit to a second test on arrival, and self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. Self-isolation can be ended early following a negative COVID-19 test taken on day seven of the isolation period.
