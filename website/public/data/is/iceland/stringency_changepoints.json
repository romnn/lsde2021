        "The number of restrictions on school activities is subject to the current advertisement restricting meetings due to epidemics. Rules on number limits and proximity limits do not apply to children born in 2005 and later.    Primary schools:  Compulsory schools are permitted, according to a further decision by the municipalities, to maintain school work in school buildings, provided that the staff who have errands in school buildings can limit the distance of 1 meter between them without the use of face masks. In other respects, there are no restrictions on gatherings of children of primary school age.    Secondary education:  In all upper secondary school buildings, school work is permitted provided that students and staff can be at least 1 meter apart. In situations where the principle of proximity cannot be enforced, such as in practical instruction, art instruction and clinical training, a face mask should be used that covers the mouth and nose. Under these circumstances, both teachers and students should try to wear a mask.  On-site studies in upper secondary schools shall be organized so that each student interacts with as few individuals as possible. Students shall be distributed on a permanent entrance to a school building as far as possible and the corridors shall be travel spaces. Regular groups and classes should be avoided as much as possible with other students.  Other non-teaching events should not take place in school buildings, such as seminars.    Universities:  In all university buildings, school work is permitted provided that students and staff can have a distance of at least 1 meter from each other. In situations where the principle of proximity cannot be enforced, such as in practical instruction, art instruction and clinical training, a face mask should be used that covers the mouth and nose. Under these circumstances, both teachers and students should try to wear a mask.  Other non-teaching events should not take place in school buildings, such as seminars.     (Restrictions on schooling apply to pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools, upper secondary education and universities, whether public or private. The decision also applies to other educational institutions, such as leisure centers, community centers and sports activities, and the same rules apply as for the relevant school level in consultation with the epidemiological authorities.)    http://web-old.archive.org/web/20200913204555/https://www.stjornartidindi.is/Advert.aspx?RecordID=611e72ee-1ee1-4d4f-a09a-1e59feef3363"

Economic assistance to companies currently struggling to remain profitable in numerous forms, including both loans and grants.  4. Tax incentives for investors.  5. Economic assistance for innovation and food production.  6. Improvements to planning and construction.  7. Reforms to the pension system.  8.

The same rules apply for after-school leisure centres for children in Grades 1-4.  - Grades 5\u201310: A maximum of 25 pupils may be together in the same space. They are required to observe the 2-metre social distancing rule; where this is not possible, they shall wear face masks. Staff must also observe the 2-metre rule and use face masks where this is not possible.  - Staff of junior schools (compulsory schools, pupils aged 6-16): A maximum of 10 staff members may be together in the same space; they are permitted to move between groups. Staff shall observe the 2-metre social distancing rule towards each other and towards pupils in Grades 5\u201310. Where this is not possible, they shall wear face masks.  - Maximum group sizes; mixing of groups: The same group divisions shall be observed among pupils in junior schools and in after-school leisure centres, so ensuring that there is no mixing between pupil groups. The rules on group sizes and mixing of groups may be set aside in common areas in schools, providing that pupils in Grades 5\u201310, and the staff, wear face masks.  - Organised sporting, youth and leisure activities, including the activities of social centres and activities for children aged 6-16, are prohibited.

Mixing of groups of pupils or students is not permitted during teaching; teaching and other staff may, however, move between groups. In common areas within the institutions, the rules on maximum gathering sizes and mixing between groups may be set aside, providing that face masks are worn.  - Practical classes, art teaching and clinical training may continue, with the same restrictions in force regarding numbers, even though it is not possible to observe the 2-metre distance rule; however, both students and teachers shall wear face masks.

        "Particular importance will be placed on vaccinating persons who are in the frontline in the battle against the pandemic. This applies to healthcare workers and others working in emergency departments and intensive care units in hospitals, on COVID-19 wards and wards for patients who have been infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers who perform screening tests in cases of suspected COVID-19 and the staff of nursing and retirement homes. The vaccination of persons living in nursing and retirement homes and old-age wards in hospitals will also have high priority.    There are ten priority groups. The groups with the greatest priority consist of a relatively few number of people; the first five groups are estimated to number around 20,000 persons.    Group 6: Persons aged 60 and older    Group 7: Persons with underlying long-term illnesses    Group 8: Employees of nursery, primary and secondary schools and select groups of social and welfare service workers    Group 9: Persons who are in sensitive circumstances due to their social and economic situation    And finally, Group 10: All others who request vaccination, as determined by the Chief Epidemiologist.    The regulation makes no provision for the COVID-19 vaccination of children born 2006 or later unless such children have an underlying long-term illness and are members of a special risk group.

        "Addition to existing travel restrictions: New border measures will come into force on February 19 which requires all arriving passengers in Iceland to present a negative PCR taken within 72 hours of their time of departure to Iceland. This is in addition to the current system of double screening, that also requires all arriving passengers to submit to a PCR test upon arrival, followed by a 5-day quarantine and a second PCR test. Those who provide valid proof of having been vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to provide a PCR-test prior to boarding and are also exempt from screening and quarantine measures at the border. The same applies to those who can provide proof of prior infection.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210307204637/https://www.government.is/government/covid-19/covid-19-news/2021/02/16/Travelers-required-to-present-negative-PCR-test-before-boarding-/",
