The first bill has to do with incentives for rent reduction by granting tax credit equal to 50% of the reduction in rent, in the case where the landlord provides a rent reduction for a period of up to three months in 2020. In order for one to become eligible for the credit, the rent reduction offered should be between 30% and 50%. In this way, the tenant is benefited and an important incentive is given to the landlord to grant the reduction, while half the reduction amount is distributed among the taxpayers.    http://web.archive.org/web/20200531210601/https://www.pio.gov.cy/coronavirus/en/press/22052020_21.pdf",

        "Travellers with proof of two COVID-19 vaccinations are not required to take a PCR test before departure or on arrival. If you have received two vaccinations you will still need to obtain a Cyprus flight pass. You should check the Cyprus Flight Pass website for information on which vaccinations are acceptable, and the length of time which should have elapsed between your final dose and date of travel. (See Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status)    Passengers coming from Red Category countries without proof of two COVID-19 vaccinations must undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and provide proof of a negative result. You must then undergo another PCR test upon arrival at Larnaca or Paphos airports. Test results should be available within three hours through the online platform. The cost of both tests is borne by the passenger.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210816105506/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/entry-requirements"
