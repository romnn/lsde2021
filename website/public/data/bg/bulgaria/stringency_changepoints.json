There are two conditions for immunization - expressed desire and informed consent.    \"We are fulfilling our commitment and adopting the National Plan on time. The country is ready and logistically to meet the first delivery of vaccines and, without wasting any time, to start immunization, which will be completely free and voluntary,\" said Borissov.    The Minister of Health reports that the necessary freezers for storing the vaccines are already available, as well as specialized transport for their delivery in the country. Angelov emphasized that the vaccination plan specifies the phases that determine which groups of the population and in what order will be immunized against the new virus - medical teams, social and pedagogical staff, the elderly over 65 years, patients with chronic diseases.\"    Parliament has backed the government plan to take part in an EU scheme and get vaccine shots from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sanofi.    Vaccines will be administered only with the permission of the European regulator. To ensure that sufficient quantities of COVID-19 vaccines are provided in the country as soon as possible, they will be delivered centrally through a joint EU public procurement mechanism.    The government expects to receive 12-13 million doses at a total cost of about EUR 250 million (USD 304 million).    https://web.archive.org/web/20201214235545/https://coronavirus.bg/bg/news/938    https://web.archive.org/web/20201214235756/https://coronavirus.bg/bg/news/939    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215015622if_/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bulgaria-vaccines/bulgaria-prepares-for-covid-19-vaccines-as-death-rates-spike-idUSKBN28E0Z3"
