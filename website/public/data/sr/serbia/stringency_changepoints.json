        "Pfizer, Sputnik V, and Sinopharm are currently in use. Negotiations are in progress for the AstraZeneca vaccine.    On 19 January, mass vaccinations began at the Belgrade Fair, Brnabic reiterated that mass vaccination of Serbian citizens is starting today and to that purpose, the first big vaccination site is opened at the Belgrade Fair and at the Torlak Institute. She specified that the first ones to be vaccinated are members of the Ministry of the Interior, the Serbian Army and other security services.    The Secretary of State appealed to the citizens to apply for vaccination in as many numbers as possible, but also to adhere to the protection and distance measures.    Because Serbia is also working on acquiring more vaccine, did not yet code as 5 as the policy as there isn't evidence yet that access is Universal with the limited supply.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210124220302/https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/166671/very-good-start-of-immunisation-in-serbia.php  https://web.archive.org/web/20210124220013/https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/166467/mass-vaccination-at-18-points-starts-in-belgrade.php  https://web.archive.org/web/20210124220138/https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/166398/mass-vaccination-in-serbia-starts-today.php",
