Laboratories in specialized medical institutions are built in full compliance with all biosafety and other quality standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO), tests are performed by highly qualified personnel, and the accuracy of test results is monitored by special programs.    Laboratory tests for coronavirus are strictly prohibited in other state and non-state medical institutions! Appropriate measures will be taken against all medical institutions violating this requirement in accordance with the law.    Recently, our citizens have some questions about the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus infections. The operational headquarters under the Cabinet of Ministers states that in order to detect coronavirus infections in a timely manner, it is important to take test samples from people who are currently from or in contact with the confirmed disease. At present, in accordance with the WHO protocol, medical examinations of these persons in the laboratories of specially allocated state medical institutions are carried out at the expense of the state budget.     If they feel the symptoms of respiratory disease (fever, weakness, cough, nausea, shortness of breath), they can immediately call the emergency number 103 (inside Baku) or 113 (outside Baku) and get a medical examination.\"    https://web.archive.org/web/20200521222910/https://nk.gov.az/az/article/692/"
