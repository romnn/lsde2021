Among these, for example, family members and people with symptoms are not allowed to visit for the entire duration of the emergency; new residents can be authorized to move in after being tested for Covid-19 and must be placed in a dedicated area, isolated from other residents. Furthermore, nursing homes are recommended to avoid sending their residents to hospitals for diagnostic tests and medical visits. Group activities and the use of shared spaces are to be suspended; all staff, suppliers and maintenance workers must be properly equipped with PPE. As soon as a resident shows signs of a likely infection s/he must be isolated and tested immediately. If positive, they must be kept in isolation when structurally possible and, otherwise, transferred to an appropriately equipped facility. Special Units for Continuity of Care (for further information please see paragraph 3.2) are responsible for guaranteeing continuous communication with infectious disease specialists and protocols to be followed will be those emitted by the Directorates of each facility.

        "https://web.archive.org/web/20200707145852/https://it.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/  US Embassy in Italy  On June 11, 2020, the Italian government issued a follow-up decree extending travel provisions that went into effect on June 3, 2020. Under these provisions, persons traveling to Italy from member states of the European Union, states party to the Schengen Agreement (the non-EU states party to the Schengen Agreement are: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), the United Kingdom, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City State will no longer be required to self-isolate under the supervision of health authorities for 14 days unless they have stayed in other countries during the 14-day period prior to entering Italy. For those traveling from a country not listed above, including the United States, travel to Italy will be allowed only for proven work, urgent health needs, or to return to your place of residence.    As travel remains banned for the majority of countries, upgraded from 2 to 3 on review.",
        "The government has announced that from 11 June so-called comfort visits, are no longer prohibited but limited to the cases established by the health management. Each region, however, rules it in its own way to determine what the preconditions for such visits are. While there is no clear start date for visits for every single region, the federal guidelines for re-opening seem to be in line with allowing visits in general, hence a downgrade to 2G seems most appropriate on review.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201203141332/https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/06/26/case-di-riposo-la-ripartenza-delle-rsa-e-in-ordine-sparso-tra-rischi-occupazionali-incertezza-sulle-visite-incognita-seconda-ondata-servono-linee-di-indirizzo-univoche/5842743/  https://web.archive.org/web/20210116211048/https://www.regione.piemonte.it/web/pinforma/notizie/regole-per-visite-nelle-case-riposo  https://web.archive.org/web/20201203141332/https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/06/26/case-di-riposo-la-ripartenza-delle-rsa-e-in-ordine-sparso-tra-rischi-occupazionali-incertezza-sulle-visite-incognita-seconda-ondata-servono-linee-di-indirizzo-univoche/5842743/"

The decree states for the school year 2021/22 lessons will be in presence from kindergarten to high school, and unless not possible for university. However, social distancing and containment measures remain: pupils (ages 6+) and teachers are required to wear masks, a distance of at least 1 metre is recommended, and entrance to school facilities and buildings is prohibited for those exhibiting respiratory or flu-like symptoms or with a temperature of 37.5 degrees and above. All school personnel has to be in possession of a COVID green pass (EU digital COVID certificate). The pass can be obtained by completing the COVID-19 vaccination cycle, being in possession of a negative molecular or antigen test taken within 48 hours, being in possession of a certificate of recovery from COVID-19 dated within six months. In case of a positive COVID-19 test in a classroom, individual regions/school district officials can decide to forgo normal containment measures in case the entire class is vaccinated. In person schooling can be stopped by region presidents if their region is in a red/orange zone and/or there is an extremely high risk of contagion.

University students though need to have green passes in order to access the facilities of their university. Universities hence are virtually closed for students without a green pass.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210914071118/https://www.adnkronos.com/scuola-e-obbligo-green-pass-primo-giorno-regole-in-classe_2qTRFcm7k4wipUZEQDtKWe  http://web.archive.org/web/20211004161458/https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/skuola/universita-come-si-torna-in-facolta-le-regole-per-lanno-accademico-2021-22_39031586-202102k.shtml",
